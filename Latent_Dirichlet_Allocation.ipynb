              " 'Clinical Scenario: Dynamic knee valgus (DKV) is a mechanical alteration in the knee that leads to increased risk of injury. Weakness of hip musculature in hip abduction (HABD), extension (HEXT), and external rotation (HER) may contribute to increased DKV in single-leg landing tasks. Focused Clinical Question: Is decreased hip strength associated with an increase in DKV during a single-leg landing task in collegiate female athletes? Summary of Key Findings: Three studies were included: One randomized control trial (RCT), one cohort study, and one case-control. All three studies found that decreases in HABD and HER strength contributed to increased DKV during single-leg landing tasks. One study also found that the hip extensors contribute to controlling hip adduction, a common factor in many mechanisms of injuries. These three studies recommended strengthening HABD, HEXT, and HER to decrease DKV and reduce the risk of injury at the knee. Clinical Bottom Line: Weak HABD, HEXT, and HER contribute to increased DKV in college female athletes, but strengthening HABD, HEXT, and HER can lead to decreases in DKV and, overall, reduce the risk of injury at the knee. Strength of Recommendation: These articles were graded with a level of evidence of III or higher, giving a grade of B strength of recommendation that weak HABD, HEXT, and HER are associated with increased DKV in collegiate female athletes.',\n",
              " 'Various methodologies have been reported to assess the real-world epidemiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the United States. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence, incidence, and geographical distribution of ALS using administrative claims data and to model future trends in ALS epidemiology.,We performed a retrospective analysis of deidentified administrative claims data for >100 million patients, using 2 separate databases (IBM MarketScan Research Databases and Symphony Health Integrated DataVerse [IDV]), to identify patients with ALS. We evaluated disease prevalence, annual incidence, age- and population-controlled geographical distribution, and expected future trends.,From 2013 to 2017, we identified 7,316 and 35,208 ALS patients from the MarketScan databases and IDV, respectively. Average annual incidence estimates were 1.48 and 1.37 per 100,000 and point prevalence estimates were 6.85 and 5.16 per 100,000 and in the United States for the MarketScan databases and IDV, respectively. Predictive modeling estimates are reported out to the year 2060 and demonstrate an increasing trend in both incident and prevalent cases.,This study provides incidence and prevalence estimates as well as geographical distribution for what the authors believe to be the largest ALS population studied to date. By using 2 separate administrative claims data sets, confidence in our estimates is increased. Future projections based on either database demonstrate an increase in ALS cases, which has also been seen in other large-scale ALS studies. These results can be used to help improve the allocation of healthcare resources in the future.',\n",

Logistic regression models were used to examine the associations with outcomes of death or disability (modified Rankin scale [mRS] scores 2-6), major disability (mRS 3-5), death, and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), with adjustment prognostic factors, alteplase dose, and mean SBP over 1-24 h.,Among 4,551 thrombolyzed AIS patients (mean age 66.7 years, 37.8% female), there were 65.4% Asians who were younger, fewer female, and with less atrial fibrillation, hypercholesterolemia, premorbid symptoms, and concomitant antihypertensive, antithrombotic and statin treatment, and more prior stroke, compared to non-Asians. Frequencies of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus were comparable between groups. Asian patients were less likely to be admitted to an acute stroke unit and receive early mobilization by a therapist or rehabilitation but more likely to receive intensive care. There were no significant differences between Asians and non-Asians in functional outcome (defined by mRS scores 2-6 or 3-5; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.19 [p = 0.958] and OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80-1.13 [p = 0.572], respectively), or death (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.95-1.65; p = 0.116), despite Asians having greater odds of ICH (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.23-1.86; p = 0.0001) and neurological deterioration within 24 h (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.18-2.12; p = 0.002).,Within the context of an international clinical trial of thrombolyzed AIS patients, demography, risk factors, management, and odds of early neurological deterioration and ICH, all differ between Asian and non-Asian participants. However, patterns of functional recovery are similar between these major regional groups.',\n",
              " \"Because hearing loss in children can result in developmental deficits, early detection and intervention are critical. This article identifies a constellation of maternal factors that predict loss to follow-up (LTF) at the point of rescreening-the first follow-up for babies who did not pass the hearing screening performed at birth-through New Jersey's early hearing detection and intervention program. Maternal factors are critical to consider, as mothers are often the primary decision makers around children's health care. All data were obtained from the state's department of health and included babies born between June 2015 and June 2017. Logistic regression was used to predict LTF. Findings indicate that non-Hispanic Black mothers, younger mothers, mothers with previous live births, and mothers with obesity were more likely to be LTF. Hispanic mothers and those enrolled in the state's Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program were less likely to be LTF. Mothers most at risk for LTF should be targeted for intervention to help children with hearing loss achieve the benefits from early intervention. Being a WIC recipient is a protective factor for LTF; therefore, elements of WIC could be used to reduce the state's LTF rate.\",\n",
              " 'Despite growing numbers in the USA, immigrant populations are underrepresented in existing physical activity (PA) research, in particular Muslim immigrant women. The current study is a pilot evaluation of a culturally adapted evidence-based PA intervention for adult Somali women. Stratified randomization was used to assign participants from a sample of 27 Somali women, aged 18 to 65, to a PA group or a waitlist control group. Bicultural Somali community research team members delivered a 12-week culturally adapted intervention available in English and Somali in a community-based setting. Process and outcome evaluation assessed changes in PA, self-efficacy for PA, access to PA resources, and wellbeing as well as feasibility and satisfaction with the program. Participants in the PA group increased their moderate to vigorous PA significantly more than those from the waitlist group from baseline to post-intervention (2 (SD = 15) to 100 (SD = 53) vs 12 (SD = 21) to 32 (SD = 44) minutes per week). Participants in the PA group had significantly greater scores in wellbeing at post-intervention compared to the waitlist group though there was no significant change from pre- to post-intervention for either group. Participants reported a high level of satisfaction with the program and preliminary evidence supports the general feasibility and acceptability of the program. Findings show that a culturally adapted intervention increased engagement in PA and was feasible and acceptable within a pilot sample of Somali women.',\n",
              " \"Historically the treatment of lupus nephritis (LN) and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) vasculitis was 'one size fits all'; however, with the emergence of precision medicine initiatives, the field is moving towards more personalized treatment approaches. The recent development of a more accurate and reproducible histopathological classification system for LN could lead to better disease categorization and therefore more targeted therapies. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of LN has provided evidence that not only T but also B cells play an important role, opening new opportunities for individualized treatment approaches. Recent trials have shown calcineurin inhibitors and the anti-CD20 antibodies rituximab and ofatumumab to be effective in the treatment of LN, adding new treatment options. State-of-the-art targeted therapy in ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) takes interindividual heterogeneity in disease severity, type of ANCA antibody [myeloperoxidase versus proteinase 3 (PR3)] and the risk for side effects of therapy into consideration. In addition, within an individual, induction therapy differs from maintenance therapy, the same holding true in incident and relapsing disease. Rituximab is now widely used in AAV and it has become clear that prolonged B cell depletion, as in LN, must be achieved to obtain a long-lasting clinical response, especially in anti-PR3-associated disease. Still, despite these advances, molecular and genetic markers are rarely incorporated into diagnostic and treatment algorithms and true precision medicine remains an aspiration that hopefully can be achieved.\",\n",
              " 'Progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus is a global public health problem accompanied by substantial comorbidities and reduced life expectancy. In this respect, CKD leading to uremia can be seen as a systemic disease with a critical impact on virtually all organ systems. Thus it is of particular importance to identify patients with incipient CKD and ongoing CKD progression, but the individual course of CKD is challenging to predict. Patterns of progression in persons with CKD include linear and nonlinear trajectories of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) loss. Kidney function can also remain stable for years, especially in the elderly. In particular, one-fifth of individuals show a substantial GFR decline in the absence of high albuminuria (nonproteinuric CKD), rendering albuminuria less suitable for predicting the progression in such individuals.',\n",
              " 'Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerular disease worldwide and since its first description extensive research has identified a number of key central pathogenetic contributors, including genetic, immunological and environmental factors. Along with its multifaceted pathophysiology, the clinical presentation of IgAN varies, ranging from mild forms with only minor urinary findings and preserved renal function to cases that rapidly progress to end-stage renal disease. Because of this, early identification of patients at risk for a progressive course is urgently needed. The search for valid and easily accessible biomarkers showed urinary Dickkopf-3 as a promising candidate to predict the course of kidney function. In addition, a recently established IgAN risk prediction tool derived from an international cohort of IgAN patients allows estimation of the risk of a 50% loss of kidney function over several years upon diagnosis. This might serve as a significant tool to individually predict the course of renal function by combining biometric, clinical, histological and treatment information at the time of diagnosis. Today there is no doubt that a comprehensive supportive treatment regimen is the main pillar for all IgAN patients. The value of an additional immunosuppressive treatment in IgAN patients at risk for disease progression is less clear. Early risk stratification and individualized therapies would be desirable for IgAN patients to facilitate the choice of treatment strategies, which is still a matter of ongoing discussion.',\n",
              " \"In kidney transplantation, precision medicine has already entered clinical practice. Donor and recipient human leucocyte antigen (HLA) regions are genotyped in two class 1 and usually three class 2 loci, and the individual degree of sensitization against alloimmune antigens is evaluated by the detection of anti-HLA donor-specific antibodies. Recently, the contribution of non-HLA mismatches to outcomes such as acute T- and B-cell-mediated rejection and even long-term graft survival was described. Tracking of specific alloimmune T- and B-cell clones by next generation sequencing and refinement of the immunogenicity of allo-epitopes specifically in the interaction with HLA and T- and B-cell receptors may further support individualized therapy. Although the choices of maintenance immunosuppression are rather limited, individualization can be accomplished by adjustment of dosing based on these risk predictors. Finally, supplementing histopathology by a transcriptomics analysis allows for a biological interpretation of the histological findings and avoids interobserver variability of results. In contrast to transplantation, the prescription of hemodialysis therapy is far from precise. Guidelines do not consider modifications by age, diet or many comorbid conditions. Patients with residual kidney function routinely receive the same treatment as those without. A major barrier hitherto is the definition of 'adequate' treatment based on urea removal. Kt/Vurea and related parameters neither reflect the severity of uremic symptoms nor predict long-term outcomes. Urea is poorly representative for numerous other compounds that accumulate in the body when the kidneys fail, yet clinicians prescribe treatment based on its measurement. Modern technology has provided the means to identify other solutes responsible for specific features of uremic illness and their measurement will be a necessary step in moving beyond the standardized prescription of hemodialysis.\",\n",
              " 'The prevalence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) continuously increases worldwide. The increasing prevalence parallels the growth in the number of people with diabetes, which is the leading cause of ESKD. Early diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with diabetes and appropriate intervention is important to delay the progression of kidney function decline and prevent ESKD. Rate of CKD progression and response to treatment varies among patients with diabetes, highlighting the need to tailor individual treatment. In this review, we describe recent advances and areas for future studies with respect to precision medicine in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). DKD is a multi-factorial disease that is subject in part to genetic heritability, but is also influenced by various exogenous mediators, such as environmental or dietary factors. Genetic testing so far has limited utility to facilitate early diagnosis, classify progression or evaluate response to therapy. Various biomarker-based approaches are currently explored to identify patients at high risk of ESKD and to facilitate decision-making for targeted therapy. These studies have led to discovery and validation of a couple of inflammatory proteins such as circulating tumour necrosis factor receptors, which are strong predictors of kidney disease progression. Moreover, risk and drug-response scores based on multiple biomarkers are developed to predict kidney disease progression and long-term drug efficacy. These findings, if implemented in clinical practice, will pave the way to move from a one-size-fits-all to a one-fit-for-everyone approach.',\n",
              " 'Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the a-galactosidase A (GLA) gene, leading to a deficiency in a-galactosidase A. The lysosomal accumulation of glycosphingolipids, primarily globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and its deacylated form, globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3), results in progressive renal failure, cardiomyopathy associated with cardiac arrhythmia and recurrent cerebrovascular events, significantly limiting life expectancy in affected patients. In male patients, a definitive diagnosis of FD involves demonstrating a GLA deficiency in leucocytes. In females, because of the potential high residual enzymatic activity, the diagnostic gold standard requires molecular genetic analyses. The current treatment options for FD include recombinant enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs) with intravenous agalsidase-a (0.2 mg/kg body weight) or agalsidase-ß (1 mg/kg body weight) every 2 weeks as well as an oral pharmacological chaperone (migalastat 123 mg every other day) that selectively and reversibly binds to the active sites of amenable mutant forms of the GLA enzyme. These therapies facilitate cellular Gb3 clearance and an overall improvement of disease burden. However, ERT can lead to infusion-associated reactions, as well as the formation of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies in ~40% of all ERT-treated males, leading to an attenuation of therapy efficacy. This article reviews the clinical presentation, diagnosis and interdisciplinary clinical management of FD and discusses the therapeutic options, with a special focus on precision medicine, accounting for individual variability in genetic mutations, Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 levels, allowing physicians to predict more accurately which prevention and treatment strategy is best for which patient.',\n",

Six students (out of 31 who completed an in-person sub-internship) participated in a 2-week virtual sub-internship, caring for patients remotely. Residents and attendings assessed those 6 students in 15 domains using the same assessment measures from the in-person sub-internship. Raters marked “unable to assess” in 75/390 responses (19%) for the virtual sub-internship versus 88/3,405 (2.6%) for the in-person sub-internship (P=0.01), most frequently for the virtual sub-internship in the domains of the physical examination (21, 81%), rapport with patients (18, 69%), and compassion (11, 42%). Students received complete assessments in most areas. Scores were higher for the in-person than the virtual sub-internship (4.67 vs. 4.45, P<0.01) for students who completed both.

              " 'Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly aggressive cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma, frequently associated with distant metastasis. However, recurrence of MCC manifesting with only pancreatic involvement is exceedingly rare. A 53-year-old man presented to our institution with abdominal discomfort 3 months after initial resection of chest wall MCC. Imaging revealed lesions in the pancreas and peripancreatic lymph nodes. Pathology obtained through endoscopic ultrasound confirmed recurrence of MCC. He underwent chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide, resulting in a complete resolution of the pancreatic lesions. Unfortunately, he passed away from sudden cardiac arrest while being in remission from MCC. Immunohistochemistry is crucial in differentiating MCC from primary pancreatic glandular and neuroendocrine tumors. While there are no definitive guidelines in the management of pancreatic lesions associated with MCC, checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy is increasingly being used.',\n",
              " 'Big data have shown their great potential value to serve many aspects of human life. Due to complexity of the medical and healthcare big data in real life, traditional big data analysis methods are difficult to be dealt with. Therefore, a single method is unable to analyze and manage heterogeneous big data sources. To utilize data fully from the perspective of decision-making, we propose a novel framework which guides the healthcare big data to be smartly and proactively processed for decision-making without user interventions. The framework contains five stages, which are intelligent data cleaning, customized data fusion, analysis mapping, exploratory visualization analysis, and generation of decision-making reports. It also enables learning from the data and correlating them with the existing human knowledge. Subsequently, a smart big data-driven application exhibits innovative management in intelligent healthcare. The proposed framework provides the guidelines of the best practices of big data-driven analysis for intelligent healthcare according to our practical applications. The platform provides the appropriate reference for the big data-driven innovation of management in intelligent healthcare.',\n",
              " 'The aim: The paper was aimed at the study of the processes of mineralization of the enamel of the permanent tooth after its eruption.,Materials and methods: To study the structure of the enamel of permanent teeth has been carried out using light and electron microscopy. The study of the process of the development of the primordia of the permanent teeth involved 10 culled puppies of 30-40 days of age. Microscopic, electron microscopic, immunohistochemical methods of research have been used to study the processes of histogenesis.,Results: The studies show that in the postnatal period, the formation of the crown, externally covered with cuticular epithelium, marks the formation of the primordium of the permanent tooth at the follicle stage. After eruption of a tooth, different parts of its crown have three individual structural and functional barriers to enamel biomineralization. The first one is provided by the cuticular epithelium of the pitted areas of the crown, which ensures filtering of the salivary fluid from the protein deposit in the form of a pellicle. The second barrier is defined on the lateral and cuspidate surfaces of the enamel, where the cuticle is erased or poorly expressed. The third structural and functional barrier of enamel biomineralization is located in the cervical portion of teeth of different classes.,Conclusions: Different areas of the enamel in the tooth crown have specific filtration barriers, which can be distinguished as follows: pit-and-fissure-and-groove, cuspidateand-approximal, and cervical barriers. The cuticle is poorly expressed or totally absent on the cusps of the tooth crowns in contrast to pitted areas.',\n",

              " \"Gunshot residue (GSR) refers to a conglomerate consisting of both organic molecules (OGSR) and inorganic species (IGSR). Historically, forensic examiners have focused only on identifying the IGSR particles by their morphology and elemental composition. Nonetheless, modern ammunition formulations and challenges with the GSR transference (such as secondary and tertiary transfer) have driven research efforts for more comprehensive examinations, requiring alternative analytical techniques. This study proposes the use of LC-MS/MS for chromatographic separation and dual detection of inorganic and organic residues. The detection of both target species in the same sample increases the confidence that chemical profiles came from a gun's discharge instead of non-firearm-related sources. This strategy implements supramolecular molecules that complex with the IGSR species, allowing them to elute from the column towards the mass spectrometer while retaining isotopic ratios for quick and unambiguous identification. The macrocycle (18-crown-6-ether) complexes with lead and barium, while antimony complexes with a chelating agent (tartaric acid).

Herein, we investigated the surface modification to enhance biological sealing, using a metal sheet and screw bonded by biomacromolecule fibrinogen mediated via pre-deposited synthetic macromolecule polydopamine (PDA) as a demonstration. We examined the effects of a Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy modified with fibrinogen (Ti-Fg), PDA (Ti-PDA) or their combination (Ti-PDA-Fg) on the biological sealing and integration with skin and bone tissues. Human epidermal keratinocytes (HaCaT), human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) and preosteoblasts (MC3T3-E1), which are closely related to percutaneous implants, exhibited better adhesion and spreading on all the three modified sheets compared with the unmodified alloy. After three-week subcutaneous implantation in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, the Ti-PDA-Fg sheets could significantly attenuate the soft tissue response and promote angiogenesis compared with other groups. Furthermore, in the model of percutaneous tibial implantation in SD rats, the Ti-PDA-Fg screws dramatically inhibited epithelial downgrowth and promoted new bone formation. Hence, the covalent immobilization of fibrinogen through the precoating of PDA is promising for enhanced biological sealing and osseointegration of metal implants with soft and hard tissues, which is critical for an orthopedic percutaneous medical device.',\n",

The IGAuNP technology provides excellent delivery efficiency of Au NPs to the cytoplasm and nucleus, thus leading to an extraordinary enhancement of the Raman signals of cells. Compared with normal Raman scattering (NRS) spectra of cells, IGAuNP-based SERS spectra not only have a high signal-to-noise ratio, but also can detect more characteristic Raman peaks, which can be used to explore more differences when comparing the biochemical components of different nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines. Based on the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) analysis of SERS spectral data, an exciting result with a diagnostic sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 100%, and accuracy of 100%, could be achieved to differentiate CNE2 and CNE1 cells, which is better than the result obtained by NRS spectroscopy.

              " 'DNA damage leads to stalled or collapsed replication forks. Replication restart primosomes re-initiate DNA synthesis at these stalled or collapsed DNA replication forks, which is important for bacterial survival. Primosomal protein PriA specifically recognizes the DNA fork structure and recruits other primosomal proteins to load the replicative helicase, in order to re-establish the replication fork. PriA binding on DNA is the first step to restart replication forks for proper DNA repair. Using a single-molecule fluorescence colocalization experiment, we measured the thermodynamic and real-time kinetic properties of fluorescence-labeled Gram-positive bacteria Geobacillus stearothermophilus PriA binding on DNA forks. We showed that PriA preferentially binds to a DNA fork structure with a fully duplexed leading strand at sub-nanomolar affinity (Kd = 268 ± 99 pM). PriA binds dynamically, and its association and dissociation rate constants can be determined using the appearance and disappearance of the fluorescence signal. In addition, we showed that PriA binds to DNA forks as a monomer using photobleaching step counting.

Modelling techniques that can accurately predict the mesomorphic phase behaviour of lipid systems are therefore of paramount importance. Here, the self-consistent field theory of Scheutjens and Fleer (SF-SCF) in which a lattice refinement has been implemented, is used to scrutinize how various additives modify the self-assembled phase behaviour of monoolein (MO) and 1,2-dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) lipids in water. The mesomorphic behaviour is inferred from trends in the mechanical properties of equilibrium lipid bilayers with increasing additive content. More specifically, we focus on the Helfrich parameters, that is, the mean and Gaussian bending rigidities (? and [small kappa, Greek, macron], respectively) supplemented with the spontaneous curvature of the monolayer (Jm0). We use previously established interaction parameters that position the unperturbed DOPC system in the lamellar La phase ([small kappa, Greek, macron] < 0, ? > 0 and Jm0 ˜ 0). Similar interaction parameters position the MO system firmly in a bicontinuous cubic phase ([small kappa, Greek, macron] > 0). In line with experimental data, a mixture of MO and DOPC tends to be in one of these two phases, depending on the mixing ratio. Moreover we find good correlations between predicted trends and experimental data concerning the phase changes of MO in response to a wide range of additives. These correlations give credibility to the use of SF-SCF modelling as a valuable tool to quickly explore the mesomorphic phase space of (phospho)lipid bilayer systems including additives.',\n",
              " 'Lung ultrasound (LUS) relies on detecting artefacts, including A-lines and B-lines, when assessing dyspnoeic patients. A-lines are horizontal artefacts and characterize normal lung, whereas multiple vertical B-lines are associated with increased lung density. We sought to assess the prevalence of A-lines and B-lines in patients with acute heart failure (AHF) and examine their clinical correlates and their relationship with outcomes.,In a prospective cohort study of adults with AHF, eight-zone LUS and echocardiography were performed early during the hospitalization and pre-discharge at an imaging depth of 18 cm. A- and B-lines were analysed separately off-line, blinded to clinical and outcome data. Of 164 patients [median age 71 years, 61% men, mean ejection fraction (EF) 40%], the sum of A-lines at baseline ranged from 0 to 19 and B-line number from 0 to 36. One hundred and fifty-six patients (95%) had co-existing A-lines and B-lines at baseline. Lower body mass index and lower chest wall thickness were associated with a higher number of A-lines (P trend < 0.001 for both). In contrast to B-lines, there was no significant change in the number of A-lines from baseline to discharge (median 6 vs. 5, P = 0.80). While B-lines were associated with 90-day HF readmission or death, A-lines were not [HR 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-2.51 vs. HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.65-1.43].,A-lines and B-lines on LUS co-exist in the vast majority of hospitalized patients with AHF. In contrast to B-lines, A-lines were not associated with adverse outcomes.',\n",
              " 'The pathogenesis of obesity-associated cardiovascular diseases begins long prior to the presentation of a cardiovascular event. In both men and women, cardiovascular events, and their associated hospitalizations and mortality, are often clinically predisposed by the presentation of a chronic cardiovascular risk factor. Obesity increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases in both sexes, however, the clinical prevalence of obesity, as well as its contribution to crucial cardiovascular risk factors is dependent on sex. The mechanisms via which obesity leads to cardiovascular risk is also discrepant in women between their premenopausal, pregnancy and postmenopausal phases of life. Emerging data indicate that at all reproductive statuses and ages, the presentation of a cardiovascular event in obese women is strongly associated with hypertension and its subsequent chronic risk factor, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). In addition, emerging evidence indicates that obesity increases the risk of both hypertension and heart failure in pregnancy. This review will summarize clinical and experimental data on the female-specific prevalence and mechanisms of hypertension and heart failure in women across reproductive stages and highlight the particular risks in pregnancy as well as emerging data in a high-risk ethnicity in women of African ancestry (AA).',\n",

              " \"The crystal structure of full-length T7 DNA polymerase in complex with its processivity factor thioredoxin and double-stranded DNA in the polymerization active site exhibits two novel structural motifs in family-A DNA polymerases: an extended ß-hairpin at the fingers subdomain, that interacts with the DNA template strand downstream the primer-terminus, and a helix-loop-helix motif (insertion1) located between residues 102 to 122 in the exonuclease domain. The extended ß-hairpin is involved in nucleotide incorporation on substrates with 5'-overhangs longer than 2 nt, suggesting a role in stabilizing the template strand into the polymerization domain. Our biochemical data reveal that insertion1 of the exonuclease domain makes stabilizing interactions that facilitate proofreading by shuttling the primer strand into the exonuclease active site. Overall, our studies evidence conservation of the 3'-5' exonuclease domain fold between family-A DNA polymerases and highlight the modular architecture of T7 DNA polymerase. Our data suggest that the intercalating ß-hairpin guides the template-strand into the polymerization active site after the T7 primase-helicase unwinds the DNA double helix ameliorating the formation of secondary structures and decreasing the appearance of indels.\",\n",
              " 'Myocardial fibrosis is associated with clinical ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VTA) events in patients with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Subepicardial or mid-wall ring-like late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) has received increasing attention in recent years. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between ring-like LGE and VTAs in DCM.,Patients diagnosed with non-ischaemic DCM who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance with LGE imaging at baseline were investigated. The composite outcome was the occurrence of VTAs defined as sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation/flutter, aborted sudden cardiac death (SCD), SCD, and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator intervention. The final cohort comprised 157 patients, including 36 (22.9%) in no LGE group, 48 (30.6%) in focal LGE group, 40 (25.5%) in multi-focal LGE group, and 33 (21%) in ring-like LGE group. Ring-like LGE group patients were younger compared to focal and multi-focal LGE group (P < 0.001) with higher left ventricular ejection fraction (33.0% vs. 24.4% vs. 22.1%, P < 0.001). After a median of 13 ± 7 months follow-up, compared to patients with no LGE, the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for VTAs were 2.90 (0.56-15.06), 5.55 (1.21-25.44), and 11.75 (2.66-51.92) for patients with focal LGE, multi-focal LGE, and ring-like LGE, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, ring-like LGE group remained associated with increased risk of VTAs (adjusted HR 10.00, 95% CI 1.54-64.98; P = 0.016) independent of the global LGE burden.,The ring-like pattern of LGE is independently associated with an increased risk of VTAs in patients with non-ischaemic DCM.',\n",
              " 'Energy conservation has long been a focal point in hibernation research. A long-standing assumption is that ambient temperature (Ta) largely defines the rate of energy expenditure because of well-known relationships between Ta, metabolic rate and frequency of arousal from torpor. Body condition and humidity also affect energy expenditure but are usually considered secondary factors. We held tricolored bats (Perimyotis subflavus) in captivity under multiple environmental conditions to directly compare the importance of Ta, fat mass and humidity for hibernation energy expenditure. Fat mass was the best predictor of female mass loss, followed by Ta and humidity. However, males had less fat and adopted a more energetically conservative hibernation strategy. Our results demonstrate that understanding the evolution of behavior, physiology and ecology of hibernation requires disentangling the relative contributions of multiple drivers of hibernation energetics, and that Ta is not always the most important factor driving energy expenditure.',\n",
              " 'Meningiomas are the most common intracranial tumours in adults and they are infrequently associated with a metastasis clinical course. Pleural metastases are extremely rare and no guidelines on a specific treatment have been established. When localized, surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment, but there is a high risk of pleural recurrence. We aimed to describe a novel surgical approach in pleural metastasis of meningiomas. We report the case of a 41-year-old man with the medical history of surgically resected intracranial atypical meningioma. Nine years after diagnosis of atypical meningioma, a CT scan of the chest disclosed 10 pleural implants gathered in the fissure, in the paramediastinal pleura and at the base of the left hemithorax. Surgical resection was decided. Parietal and mediastinal pleura resection with visceral pleural lesions removal were performed. Cytoreductive surgery was associated with intrathoracic hyperthermic chemotherapy. Postoperative course was uneventful and no adjuvant therapy was undertaken. The patient is free of pleural recurrence 12 months post operatively. The present case report suggests that cytoreductive surgery with intrathoracic hyperthermic chemotherapy is feasible and safe in pleural metastasis from meningioma. Prolonged follow-up and prospective studies are mandatory to assess its oncological benefit.',\n",

All enrolled patients visited the outpatient clinic and underwent 24-h Holter monitoring at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery and annually thereafter.,A total of 91 consecutive patients [age, 58.0 (interquartile interval from 52.0 to 62.0) years; male, 71.4%] with paroxysmal (67%) or persistent/long-standing persistent (33%) AF were enrolled. After a median follow-up of 48 months (interquartile interval from 36 to 60 months), freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmias without antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) was 76.5%, 66.0% and 66.0% for paroxysmal AF and 58.6%, 47.8% and 34.2% for persistent/long-standing persistent AF at 12, 36 and 60 months, respectively (P = 0.017).

              " \"The predicted rise of global temperatures is of major concern for ectotherms because of its direct impact on their behavior and physiology. As physiological performance mediates a species' resilience to warming exposure, physiological plasticity could greatly reduce the susceptibility to climate change. We studied the degree to which Diplolaemus leopardinus lizards are able to adjust behavioral and physiological traits in response to short periods of temperature change. We used a split cross design to measure the acclimation response of preferred body temperature (Tp), and the thermal performance curve of resting metabolic rate (RMR) and evaporative water loss (EWL). Our results showed that plasticity differs among traits: whereas Tp and EWL showed lower values in warm conditions, the body temperature at which RMR was highest increased. Moreover, RMR was affected by thermal history, showing a large increase in response to cold exposure in the group initially acclimated to warm temperatures. The reduction of EWL and the increase in optimal temperature will give lizards the potential to partially mitigate the impact of rising temperatures in the energy cost and water balance. However, the decrease in Tp and the sensitivity to the warm thermal history of RMR could be detrimental to the energy net gain, increasing the species' vulnerability, especially considering the increase of heat waves predicted for the next 50\\xa0years. The integration of acclimation responses in behavioral and physiological traits provides a better understanding of the range of possible responses of lizards to cope with the upcoming climatic and environmental modifications expected as a result of climate change.\",\n",

Novel variations that are unique to the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) spike glycoprotein, i. e. L452R-E484Q, may play a different role in the B.1.617 (also known as G/452R.V3) variant's pathogenicity and better survival compared to the wild type. Therefore, a thorough analysis is needed to understand the impact of these mutations on binding with host receptor (RBD) and to guide new therapeutics development. In this study, we used structural and biomolecular simulation techniques to explore the impact of specific mutations (L452R-E484Q) in the B.1.617 variant on the binding of RBD to the host receptor ACE2. Our analysis revealed that the B.1.617 variant possesses different dynamic behaviours by altering dynamic-stability, residual flexibility and structural compactness. Moreover, the new variant had altered the bonding network and structural-dynamics properties significantly. MM/GBSA technique was used, which further established the binding differences between the wild type and B.1.617 variant. In conclusion, this study provides a strong impetus to develop novel drugs against the new SARS-CoV-2 variants.\",\n",

At the 3- and 12-month follow-up, all three groups showed a significant decrease in the average number of hospitalizations compared to baseline. The interventions were not significantly different from UHC.,The results of this post hoc analysis show that, during the study period, decreases in hospitalizations in the intervention groups were comparable to those in UHC, and deploying NPs provided no detectable value added. Future research should focus on testing ways to optimize UHC services.',\n",

The outcome was no pharmacological pain medications, as needed only (pro re nata [PRN]), as scheduled only, or as scheduled with PRN medications. We estimated adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals from multinomial logistic models.,Relative to residents with vocal complaints only, those with one pain behavior documented (i.e., nonverbal, facial, or protective behavior) were more likely to lack pain medication versus scheduled and PRN medications. Residents with multiple pain behaviors documented were least likely to have no treatment relative to scheduled with PRN medications, PRN only, or scheduled only pain medication regimens.,The type and number of pain behaviors observed are associated with pharmacological pain management regimen. Improving staff recognition of pain among residents unable to self-report is warranted in nursing homes.',\n",

The screening strategy consists in splitting the exploration of the adsorbate-surface configurational space into chemically meaningful domains, that is, by choosing among different conformers to adsorb, surface adsorption sites, adsorbate anchoring points, and orientations and allowing dissociation of (acidic) protons. We demonstrate the performance of the main features based on varying examples, ranging from CO adsorption on a gold nanoparticle to sorbitol adsorption on hematite.

              " 'Using chemically synthesized silver nanowires with 5-fold twinning planes as a model system, a bottom-up process to generate a bulk nanostructured metal has been demonstrated. Although the nanowires would be shortened and deformed during densification, they are chosen as a model system because they are currently the most scalable and convenient way to obtain Ag particles with high twinning densities. Direct cold pressing of a silver nanowire filter cake did not generate a sufficiently cohesive sample, while hot pressing at 190 °C for 8 h resulted in extensive sintering, eliminating the nanowire morphology. Copper was then electroplated on the silver nanowires as a binder and filler to increase the densification upon hot pressing; despite nonuniform plating across the thickness of the filter cake, the thermal stability of the nanowires was increased, allowing hot pressing at 390 °C. Finally, a uniform copper coating on silver nanowires was achieved by electroless plating, leading to cohesive bulk metal after hot pressing.',\n",

However, the presence of the parasite reservoir in the form of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), a dermal sequel of VL, is a hurdle in attaining VL elimination. Presently employed clinical specimens for the diagnosis of PKDL include skin biopsy specimens and slit skin smears. In this study, the use of blood as a clinical specimen was investigated in different manifestations of PKDL in India. This is a bicentric study (National Institute of Pathology, Indian Council of Medical Research [ICMR], New Delhi, and Institute of Medical Sciences [IMS], Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi), with 215 participants (120 PKDL patients and 95 controls). Highly sensitive quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) and field-deployable loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) were employed using blood samples for diagnosis. Promising sensitivities of 77.50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69.24 to 84.05%) for Q-PCR and 70.83% (95% CI, 62.16 to 78.22%) for LAMP were obtained for the diagnosis of PKDL. Further, enhanced sensitivities of 83.33% (95% CI, 71.28 to 90.98%) and 77.78% (95% CI, 65.06 to 86.80%) for Q-PCR and LAMP, respectively, were recorded for the detection of macular cases. The study revealed an inverse correlation between the parasite load estimated in slit and blood samples, thereby favoring the use of blood for the diagnosis of the macular variant, which may be missed due to scant parasite loads in the slit. This study is the first to propose the promising potential of blood as a clinical specimen for accurate diagnosis of PKDL, which would aid in fast-tracking VL elimination.',\n",

V3-loop amino acid variants observed in individual maraviroc-resistant viruses have not been found to be predictive of reduced susceptibility. Sequence-database searches have demonstrated that approximately 7.3% of viruses naturally encode these variants, raising concerns regarding potential pre-existing resistance. A study from Russia reported that combinations of these same amino acids are present in the V3 loops of the Russian variant subtype A (IDU-A, now A6) with a much greater prevalence (range: 74.4%-92.3%) depending on the combination. However, these studies and database searches did not include phenotypic evaluation.,Sixteen Russian HIV-1 isolates (including sub-subtype A6 viruses) were assessed for V3 loop sequence and phenotypic susceptibility to maraviroc.,All 12 of the A6 viruses and 2/4 subtype B isolates encoded V3-loop variants that have previously been identified in individual virus isolates with reduced susceptibility to maraviroc. However, despite the prevalence of these V3-loop amino acid variants among the tested viruses, phenotypic sensitivity to maraviroc was observed in all instances. Similarly, reduced susceptibility to maraviroc was not found in virus from participants who experienced virologic failure in a clinical study of maraviroc in Russia (A4001101, [NCT01275625]).,Altogether, these data confirm that the presence of individual or combinations of V3-loop amino acid residues in sub-subtype A6 viruses alone does not predict natural resistance to maraviroc and that V3-loop genotype analysis of R5 virus prior to treatment is not helpful in predicting clinical outcome.',\n",

              " 'Bone formation and resorption are typically coupled, such that the efficacy of anabolic osteoporosis treatments may be limited by bone destruction. The multi-kinase inhibitor YKL-05-099 potently inhibits salt inducible kinases (SIKs) and may represent a promising new class of bone anabolic agents. Here, we report that YKL-05-099 increases bone formation in hypogonadal female mice without increasing bone resorption. Postnatal mice with inducible, global deletion of SIK2 and SIK3 show increased bone mass, increased bone formation, and, distinct from the effects of YKL-05-099, increased bone resorption. No cell-intrinsic role of SIKs in osteoclasts was noted. In addition to blocking SIKs, YKL-05-099 also binds and inhibits CSF1R, the receptor for the osteoclastogenic cytokine M-CSF. Modeling reveals that YKL-05-099 binds to SIK2 and CSF1R in a similar manner. Dual targeting of SIK2/3 and CSF1R induces bone formation without concomitantly increasing bone resorption and thereby may overcome limitations of most current anabolic osteoporosis therapies.',\n",

              " 'An androgen receptor (AR) is an intensively studied treatment target for castration-resistant prostate cancer that is irresponsive to conventional antiandrogen therapeutics. Binding function 3 (BF3) inhibitors with alternative modes of action have emerged as a promising approach to overcoming antiandrogen resistance. However, how these BF3 inhibitors modulate AR function remains elusive, hindering the development of BF3-targeting agents. Here, we performed an integrated computational study to interrogate the binding mechanism of several known BF3 inhibitors with ARs. Our results show that the inhibitory effect of the BF3 antagonists arises from their allosteric modulation of the activation function (AF2) site, which alters the dynamic coupling between the BF3 and AF2 sites as well as the AF2-coactivator (SRC2-3) interaction. Moreover, the per-residue binding energy analyses reveal the anchor role of the linker connecting the phenyl ring and benzimidazole/indole in these BF3 inhibitors. Furthermore, the allosteric driver-interacting residues are found to include both positive, e.g., Phe673 and Asn833, and negative ones, e.g., Phe826, and the differential interactions with these residues provide an explanation why stronger binding does not necessarily result in higher inhibitory activities. Finally, our allosteric communication pathway analyses delineate how the allosteric signals triggered by BF3 binding are propagated to the AF2 pocket through multiple short- and/or long-ranged transmission pathways. Collectively, our combined computational study provides a comprehensive structural mechanism underlying how the selected set of BF3 inhibitors modulate AR function, which will help guide future development of BF3 antagonists.',\n",

              " 'Understanding the lateral organization in plasma membranes remains an open problem and is of great interest to many researchers. Model membranes consisting of coexisting domains are commonly used as simplified models of plasma membranes. The coarse-grained (CG) Martini force field has successfully captured spontaneous separation of ternary membranes into a liquid-disordered and a liquid-ordered domain. With all-atom (AA) models, however, phase separation is much harder to achieve due to the slow underlying dynamics. To remedy this problem, here, we apply the virtual site (VS) hybrid method on a ternary membrane composed of saturated lipids, unsaturated lipids, and cholesterol to investigate the phase separation. The VS scheme couples the two membrane leaflets at CG and AA resolution. We found that the rapid phase separation reached by the CG leaflet can accelerate and guide this process in the AA leaflet.',\n",
              " 'Longitudinal studies assessing durability of the anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) humoral immune response have generated conflicting results. This has been proposed to be due to differences in patient populations, the lack of standardized methodologies, and the use of assays that measure distinct aspects of the humoral response. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were serially measured in sera from a cohort of 44 well-characterized convalescent plasma donors over 120 days post-COVID-19 symptom onset, utilizing eight assays, which varied according to antigen source, the detected antibody isotype, and the activity measured (i.e., binding, blocking, or neutralizing). While the majority of assays demonstrated a gradual decline in antibody titers over the course of 120 days, the two electrochemiluminescence immunoassay Roche assays (Roche Diagnostics Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 [qualitative, nucleocapsid based] and Roche Diagnostics Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S [semiquantitative, spike based]), which utilize dual-antigen binding for antibody detection, demonstrated stable and/or increasing antibody titers over the study period. This study is among the first to assess longitudinal, rather than cross-sectional, SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles among convalescent COVID-19 patients, primarily using commercially available serologic assays with Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization. We show that SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection is dependent on the serologic method used, which has implications for future assay utilization and clinical value.',\n",
              " 'Vascular malformations, affecting ˜1% to 1.5% of the population, comprise a spectrum of developmental patterning defects of capillaries, arteries, veins, and/or lymphatics. The majority of vascular malformations occur sporadically; however, inherited malformations exist as a part of complex congenital diseases. The malformations, ranging from birthmarks to life-threatening conditions, are present at birth, but may reveal signs and symptoms-including pain, bleeding, disfigurement, and functional defects of vital organs-in infancy, childhood, or adulthood. Vascular malformations often exhibit recurrent patterns at affected sites due to the lack of curative treatments.

              " 'Lymphatic vessels maintain tissue fluid homeostasis by returning to blood circulation interstitial fluid that has extravasated from the blood capillaries. They provide a trafficking route for cells of the immune system, thus critically contributing to immune surveillance. Developmental or functional defects in the lymphatic vessels, their obstruction or damage, lead to accumulation of fluid in tissues, resulting in lymphedema. Here we discuss developmental lymphatic anomalies called lymphatic malformations and complex lymphatic anomalies that manifest as localized or multifocal lesions of the lymphatic vasculature, respectively. They are rare diseases that are caused mostly by somatic mutations and can present with variable symptoms based upon the size and location of the lesions composed of fluid-filled cisterns or channels. Substantial progress has been made recently in understanding the molecular basis of their pathogenesis through the identification of their genetic causes, combined with the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms in animal disease models and patient-derived lymphatic endothelial cells. Most of the solitary somatic mutations that cause lymphatic malformations and complex lymphatic anomalies occur in genes that encode components of oncogenic growth factor signal transduction pathways. This has led to successful repurposing of some targeted cancer therapeutics to the treatment of lymphatic malformations and complex lymphatic anomalies. Apart from the mutations that act as lymphatic endothelial cell-autonomous drivers of these anomalies, current evidence points to superimposed paracrine mechanisms that critically contribute to disease pathogenesis and thus provide additional targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, we review these advances and discuss new treatment strategies that are based on the recently identified molecular pathways.',\n",
              " 'Cerebral cavernous malformations are acquired vascular anomalies that constitute a common cause of central nervous system hemorrhage and stroke. The past 2 decades have seen a remarkable increase in our understanding of the pathogenesis of this vascular disease. This new knowledge spans genetic causes of sporadic and familial forms of the disease, molecular signaling changes in vascular endothelial cells that underlie the disease, unexpectedly strong environmental effects on disease pathogenesis, and drivers of disease end points such as hemorrhage. These novel insights are the integrated product of human clinical studies, human genetic studies, studies in mouse and zebrafish genetic models, and basic molecular and cellular studies. This review addresses the genetic and molecular underpinnings of cerebral cavernous malformation disease, the mechanisms that lead to lesion hemorrhage, and emerging biomarkers and therapies for clinical treatment of cerebral cavernous malformation disease. It may also serve as an example for how focused basic and clinical investigation and emerging technologies can rapidly unravel a complex disease mechanism.',\n",
              " 'Appropriate vascular function is essential for the maintenance of central nervous system homeostasis and is achieved through virtue of the blood-brain barrier; a specialized structure consisting of endothelial, mural, and astrocytic interactions. While appropriate blood-brain barrier function is typically achieved, the central nervous system vasculature is not infallible and cerebrovascular anomalies, a collective terminology for diverse vascular lesions, are present in meningeal and cerebral vasculature supplying and draining the brain. These conditions, including aneurysmal formation and rupture, arteriovenous malformations, dural arteriovenous fistulas, and cerebral cavernous malformations, and their associated neurological sequelae, are typically managed with neurosurgical or pharmacological approaches. However, increasing evidence implicates interacting roles for inflammatory responses and disrupted central nervous system fluid flow with respect to vascular perturbations. Here, we discuss cerebrovascular anomalies from an immunologic angle and fluid flow perspective. We describe immune contributions, both common and distinct, to the formation and progression of diverse cerebrovascular anomalies. Next, we summarize how cerebrovascular anomalies precipitate diverse neurological sequelae, including seizures, hydrocephalus, and cognitive effects and possible contributions through the recently identified lymphatic and glymphatic systems. Finally, we speculate on and provide testable hypotheses for novel nonsurgical therapeutic approaches for alleviating neurological impairments arising from cerebrovascular anomalies, with a particular emphasis on the normalization of fluid flow and alleviation of inflammation through manipulations of the lymphatic and glymphatic central nervous system clearance pathways.',\n",

Given the high prevalence of suicidal behaviors and suicide, youth suicide researchers must approach participants, families, and communities with care. Special attention must be given to suicide-related trauma among survivors of suicidal behaviors and of suicide. In this article, we discuss how investigators can infuse the trauma-informed model in their work. Our discussion is organized around research stages and tasks: study design, recruitment, data collection and analysis, and care for the research team. We illustrate the integration of the trauma-informed (TI) model key elements and principles with examples from our work in youth suicide research. We posit that infusing the TI model in research aligns with the ethical mandate of beneficence. Our goal is to help other researchers reflect on how to design and implement TI informed research that is attuned to participants, staff, and communities.

              " 'Cognitive distortions are conceptualized as one of the most potent predictors of suicide. However, little is known about the mediating and moderating mechanisms linking cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation. The present study examined a prospective moderated mediation model linking cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation, with drug use, social problem-solving, and perceived burdensomeness as the mediators and childhood sexual abuse as the moderator. Participants included 150 homeless youth who participated in a randomized clinical trial for suicide intervention. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. We analyzed the data using a multiple-group path model. Findings showed that social problem-solving and perceived burdensomeness sequentially mediated the association between cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation regardless of childhood sexual abuse, whereas drug use mediated the association between cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation only among youth reporting no history of sexual abuse. Findings highlight how coping processes, both adaptive and maladaptive, operate differently to predict suicidal ideation contingent on the effects of childhood sexual abuse in the context of cognitive distortions. Findings also underscore the importance of addressing the effects of childhood abuse to facilitate the efficiency of interventions that seek to reduce suicidal ideation among a vulnerable population.

This article investigates the relations between cognitive availability of historical trauma, historical trauma symptoms, and negative mental health outcomes in a sample of young Kurds who live in the Region of Kurdistan in Iraq. We also examined the potential protective role of strong identification as members of a national minority (Iraqi Kurds) and as members of an ethnic group (Kurdish people in general). The results showed that tragic group history is significantly related to negative mental health outcomes among young Iraqi Kurds. However, strong identification with other Iraqi Kurds (but not with Kurds in general) had an attenuating effect on the link between historical trauma and present-day negative mental health outcomes.

A better understanding of how this process unfolds among young people with marginalized identities can help inform strategies to decrease mental health disparities and improve their overall health outcomes. A mixed method, convergent parallel design was used to examine identity centrality, mental health treatment history, and cultural experiences of a purposeful sample, consisting of 31 Black and Latinx young adults (Mage = 22.16) who identified as sexual and gender minorities in New York City. Data from validated measures and in-depth interviews were triangulated to strengthen and add context to findings. Participants with higher social identity centrality scores, particularly on community belonging and sexual identity, were more likely to continuously use mental health services. Seven social identities were prominent in qualitative data: Sexual, Ethnic-racial, Religious, Socioeconomic, Gender, Family, and Generational. These social identities were described as interconnected, and as both significant barriers and facilitators to participants' involvement in treatment. Results suggested that young lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) people of color seeking mental health care might need more support to navigate experiences related to intersecting identities. Interventions to improve services and maintain these youth in treatment should employ strategies to assess and support positive minority identity development, while also addressing self-stigma and discrimination experienced through culture, family, and mental health professionals. Considering social identity development is conceptually useful for adapting services for diverse youth because it is a major focus of transitioning to adulthood and calls attention to multiple minority identities impacting individual clients.

              " 'Adverse childhood experiences and other potentially traumatic events have lasting implications for mental health. Evidence-based treatments are available to address trauma-related symptoms, but their impact is hindered because access is limited and unequal. In the U.S., adverse experiences and mental disorders disproportionately affect socioeconomically disadvantaged groups that face treatment access barriers-disparities that are compounded by passive systems of care that wait for clients to seek treatment. This article presents a conceptual argument, backed by empirical evidence, that population health can be improved by implementing trauma-responsive practices, and that greater mental health equity can be achieved if these strategies are used to engage underserved clients. A description is provided of the Trauma Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (T-SBIRT), a promising protocol that can be used by nonclinical providers to detect trauma-related mental health concerns in adults and help them access therapeutic services. The T-SBIRT protocol has been successfully implemented in diverse settings, and it is currently being piloted in a universal postpartum home visiting program called Family Connects. Prior results from three trials of Family Connects are summarized, including evidence of program impact on maternal mental health. New results are also presented indicating that T-SBIRT is feasible to implement within Family Connects, as denoted by indicators of suitability, tolerability, provider adherence, and referral acceptance. Closing recommendations are offered for reducing mental health disparities by testing and disseminating T-SBIRT through Family Connects and other large-scale programs and systems of care.

              " 'Given the strong relationship between road accident and traffic speed, the evaluation and prediction of this latter have always been considered as a critical issue for road safety analysis and for the evaluation of road network safety improvements. Prediction models developed to date mainly focused on spot speed in a rural environment or on running speed in an urban one. Very few analyze the speed estimation in transition areas. The objective of this paper is to develop a generalized speed estimation model able to predict mean speed in urban, rural, and transition environment as a function of road layout characteristics. It is believed that the proposed estimation tool can be effectively employed by road engineers in the road safety design and retrofitting stage.,The basic idea of the paper is to shed some light on this issue by making use of a hybrid estimation approach able to combine the information gathered from both previously mentioned models within a generalized speed adaptation framework that reflects road user behavior. The calibration and validation of the generalized estimation model have been carried out following a collection of Floating Car Data (FCD) on several candidate sites.,Preliminary results seem to indicate that the methodology proposed may be effective in estimating the spot speed in two-lane rural and urban arterials.,FCD data can be useful to develop more efficient estimation models to better manage the safety of urban and rural roads.',\n",

The pandemic has created tremendous fear of death from infection and awful psychological pressure on healthcare professionals (HCPs). The measures of psychological effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Bangladeshi HCPs are unknown. The present study aimed to assess the mental health outcomes of Bangladeshi HCPs and associated risk factors. We conducted this cross-sectional study from July 15 to September 20, 2020. A total of 355 HCPs aged between 20 and 60 years residing in Bangladesh participated in this study. All the participants completed a self-administered questionnaire through Google Forms consisting of socio-demographic characteristics and mental health outcomes. We measure loneliness, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance using the UCLA loneliness scale-8, patient health questionnaire-9, 7-item generalized anxiety disorder scale, Pittsburgh sleep quality index. The present study observed the prevalence of loneliness, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance among HCPs were 89%, 44%, 78%, and 87%, respectively. The factors significantly associated with the development of mental health problems among HCPs were working environment, economic condition, education level, area of residence, marital status, gender differences, professional category, body mass index, and smoking habit. Moreover, we have seen significant correlations among the different mental health outcomes. In Bangladesh, a large portion of HCPs reported mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic incredibly impacted the psychological health of Bangladeshi healthcare professionals. Appropriate supportive programs and interventional initiatives might help the HCPs with mental health problems during and after this pandemic.',\n",

This study aimed to explore the trend of COVID-19 infection in a peripheral region of Bangladesh during one of the largest festivals to develop an evidence-based hypothesis for its influence on the transmission rate of COVID-19. This study conducted a quantitative analysis of secondary data on COVID-19 collected from the Directorate General of Health Services Bangladesh (DGHS) and divisional director's office in the Mymensingh division. To explore the influence of one of the biggest festivals (Eid-ul-Adha) on the trend of COVID-19 infection, we analyzed data from a week before the festival to 2 weeks following the festival. The infection rate (positive cases per million of the population) and the test positivity rate (positive cases among the total number of conducted diagnostic tests) of each day during this period were calculated both for the Mymensingh region and national level. Both the test positivity rate (TPR) and infection rates in the Mymensingh region demonstrated an increasing trend. The mean test positivity rate of the Mymensingh region on the week before the festival was 9.5%. It increased to a mean test positivity rate of 13% in the following week and further rose to a rate of 17% in the next week. The infection rate of Mymensingh also increased more than 2 folds from the day of the festival (2.0-5.3 cases per million) within the next 2 weeks. The TPR and infection rate on the national level remained similar throughout the study period. Mass mobility during Eid-ul-Adha influences the increased transmission of COVID-19 among the peripheral regions of Bangladesh from the central capital city Dhaka. The findings will help policymakers plan and implement travel restrictions during festivals during the pandemic in LMICs.\",\n",

It is often used to reduce the overfitting problem of training DNNs and further improve classification performance. In this paper, we aim to investigate how to generate more reliable soft labels. We present an Online Label Smoothing (OLS) strategy, which generates soft labels based on the statistics of the model prediction for the target category. The proposed OLS constructs a more reasonable probability distribution between the target categories and non-target categories to supervise DNNs. Experiments demonstrate that based on the same classification models, the proposed approach can effectively improve the classification performance on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and fine-grained datasets. Additionally, the proposed method can significantly improve the robustness of DNN models to noisy labels compared to current label smoothing approaches.

Therefore, this paper proposes a network decomposition model based on Improved Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), it is suitable for time-frequency analysis of brain functional network. On the one hand, it solves the problem of mode mixing on original EMD method, especially on high-density EEG data. On the other hand, by building brain function networks on different intrinsic mode function (IMF), we can perform time-frequency analysis of brain function connections. It provides a new insight for brain function connectivity analysis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Experimental results found that the IMFs waveform decomposed by Improved EMD was more stable and the difference between IMFs was obvious, it indicated that the mode mixing can be effectively solved. Besides, the analysis of the brain network, we found that the changes in MDD functional connectivity on different IMFs, it may be related to the pathological changes for MDD. More statistical results on three network metrics proved that there were significant differences between MDD and normal controls (NC) group.

This randomized controlled trial included patients in the intervention (n = 24) and control (n = 24) groups who completed 15 weeks of ankle training. The experimental group performed ankle dorsiflexion using a pressure-activated pedal switch connected to the web games. The control group performed ankle dorsiflexion exercises using a pedal switch that operated a home appliance (a fan). Standing balance and walking performance were estimated using the Zebris FDM system, a pressure force platform, the Pediatric Balance Scale score, and the 1-minute walk test. The pre- and posttest data were analyzed using analysis of variance and analysis of covariance, which revealed that the intervention group had more significant improvements in sway patterns and balance and walking. The developed facility of a modified pedal switch integrated with web games can achieve better exercise adherence to promote balance and walking performance than that with home appliances.

However, within a few months of birth, ASL pH increases to match that in non-CF airways. Although the physiological basis for the increase is unknown, this time course matches the development of inflammation in CF airways. To learn whether inflammation alters CF ASL pH, we treated CF epithelia with TNF-a and IL-17 (TNF-a+IL-17), 2 inflammatory cytokines that are elevated in CF airways. TNF-a+IL-17 markedly increased ASL pH by upregulating pendrin, an apical Cl-/HCO3- exchanger. Moreover, when CF epithelia were exposed to TNF-a+IL-17, clinically approved CFTR modulators further alkalinized ASL pH. As predicted by these results, in vivo data revealed a positive correlation between airway inflammation and CFTR modulator-induced improvement in lung function. These findings suggest that inflammation is a key regulator of HCO3- secretion in CF airways. Thus, they explain earlier observations that ASL pH increases after birth and indicate that, for similar levels of inflammation, the pH of CF ASL is abnormally acidic. These results also suggest that a non-cell-autonomous mechanism, airway inflammation, is an important determinant of the response to CFTR modulators.',\n",

Frequency and duration of exercise were assessed based on the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists exercise guidelines. Regression analyses examined the association between stress and exercise controlling for covariates. Content analysis was used to understand women's stress management experiences.,N = 114 women completed the questionnaire and a subgroup of 11 received follow-up interviews. Greater frequency of exercise was significantly associated with lower levels of stress. Approximately one-third of women reported experiencing significant stress. Talking to their husband or partner was the most used and exercise was the least used coping strategy. Many women recognized the importance of managing stress and benefits of exercise, but were hindered by barriers such as feeling tired, preventing them from exercising.,A personalized and safe exercise program has the potential to be a low-cost stress management strategy for women during pregnancy and postpartum.\",\n",

The purpose of this study was to explore the association between perceived insufficient milk in the first 3 months and infant factors, maternal factors, professional support, parenting decisions, and breastfeeding concerns. Sixty-nine mothers who had perceived insufficient milk and 301 mothers who did not were included.,A cross-sectional online survey design was used in a convenience sample of 370 U.S. mothers with a healthy singleton infant between 1 and 12 weeks who were breastfeeding directly on the breast as part of their feeding methods.,Using stratified multivariable logistic regression, we found that among 102 mothers of infants < 4 weeks of age, planned breastfeeding duration < 6 months (OR = 13.17; 95% CI [1.42, 122.48], p = .024), and concerns about infant crying or fussing (OR = 4.72; 95% CI [1.10, 20.00], p = .03) were associated with perceived insufficient milk. Among 256 mothers of infants 4 to 12 weeks of age, concerns about frequent feedings (OR = 4.05; 95% CI [1.95, 8.40], p = .000) and latching difficulty (OR = 2.95; 95% CI [1.33, 6.54], p = .008) were associated with perceived insufficient milk.,Association between factors and perceived insufficient milk differed based on infant age. Maternal perceptions of crying or fussing, frequent feedings, and latching difficulty need to be assessed because of its attribution to perceived insufficient milk.',\n",

Platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome (POS), in which hypoxemia in the upright position improves with relocating to a recumbent position, can be a rare cause of hypoxemia. This syndrome is more likely to occur in patients with an intracardiac shunt and aortic malformation. Hypoxemic symptoms present in our patient were paradoxical to those of common POS due to the highly tortuous descending thoracic aorta (DTA) and Eustachian valve. Therefore, establishing the diagnosis was difficult. POS should be suspected when patients with high tortuosity and curvature of DTA show hypoxemia.',\n",

Numerous factors influence self-reported physical and mental health outcome scores. The purpose of this study was to examine if an association exists between insurance payer type and baseline PROM scores in patients diagnosed with hip osteoarthritis.,We retrospectively reviewed the baseline PROM scores of 5,974 patients diagnosed with hip osteoarthritis according to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code within our institutional database from 2015 to 2020. We examined Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function Short-form (HOOS-PS), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function Short Form 10a (PF10a), PROMIS Global-Mental, and PROMIS Global-Physical scores. Descriptive analyses, analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and post hoc analyses were utilized to assess variations in PROM scores across insurance type.,The mean age (and standard deviation) of the study population was 63.5 ± 12.2 years, and 55.7% of patients were female. The Medicaid cohort had a comparatively higher percentage of Black, Hispanic, and non-English-speaking patients and a lower median household income. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was highest in the Medicare and Medicaid insurance cohorts. Patients utilizing commercial insurance consistently demonstrated the highest baseline PROMs, and patients utilizing Medicaid consistently demonstrated the lowest baseline PROMs. Subsequent analyses found significantly poorer mean scores for the Medicaid cohort for all 4 PROMs when compared with the commercial insurance and Medicare cohorts. These score differences exceeded the minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs). For the PROMIS Global-Mental subscore, a significantly lower mean score was observed for the Workers' Compensation and motor vehicle insurance cohort when compared with the commercial insurance and Medicare cohort. This difference also exceeded the MCID.,PROM scores in patients with hip osteoarthritis varied among those with different insurance types. Variations in certain demographic and health indices are potential drivers of these observed baseline PROM differences. For patients with hip osteoarthritis, the use of PROMs for research, clinical, or quality-linked payment metrics should acknowledge baseline variation between patients with different insurance types.,Prognostic Level IV.

Moreover, the best training method for improving laparoscopic surgical skills under varying operator line of sight, camera, and monitor positions is unknown. We aimed to investigate the role of laparoscopic training under mirror-image conditions in improving surgical efficiency and whether prior surgical experience affects such training.,This prospective study was conducted at the Department of Surgical Oncology, Tokyo University, Japan. Twenty-five surgeons participated. Novice (n=14), trained (n=7), and expert (n=4) participants performed the simulated task in a box trainer while varying the positional relationships among the surgeons, camera, and monitor. Five patterns were repeatedly performed 5 times per day for 4 days over 2 weeks.,The most significant differences in terms of the time required to complete the task under mirror-image conditions among the 3 groups were on day 1 (novices: 185.8 s, trained: 79.7 s, and experts: 46.5 s, P=0.009). However, after 4 days of training, the corresponding times did not differ among the 3 groups (26.0, 30.7, and 23.1 s, respectively; P=0.415). Laparoscopic training was sufficiently effective under mirror-image conditions.,Mirror-image surgical conditions provided the most difficult setting, because surgeons and assistants often became disoriented, and task performance was most degraded. However, just 4 days of training was found to be sufficient to overcome the difficulties encountered while performing laparoscopic procedures under mirror-image conditions.',\n",
              " 'BACKGROUND Pyometra is an accumulation of pus in the uterine cavity. It is rare in the general population but more common in elderly women. If diagnosed in the early stage, life-threating conditions may be avoided. The most common etiological microorganisms of pyometra are Escherichia coli, Bacteroides species, Staphylococci (eg, epidermidis) and Streptococci. Occasionally, atypical bacteria may be the cause. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 75-year-old woman, with multiple risk factors, admitted to the Gynecology Department with a 15-day history of yellowish-brown vaginal discharge. Because of rapid enlargement of the uterine cavity, the patient underwent to endometrial curettage. Three hours after surgery, she developed a high-grade fever, and Streptococcus constellatus was isolated in her blood cultures. A specific antibiotic therapy was administered for a total of 14 days, resulting in complete resolution of the infection. CONCLUSIONS This case report describes a rare case of bacteremia caused by Streptococcus constellatus, that resulted from a pyometra. The classic triad of symptoms (postmenopausal bleeding, vaginal discharge, and lower abdominal pain) may be helpful for diagnosis; however, 50% of patients are asymptomatic. An early recognition of the condition is important to avoid rare but risky consequences, such as perforation of the uterus itself. Nevertheless, surgery can cause dangerous complications such as bacteremia. A different spectrum of bacteria may be involved in the development of pyometra, even in atypical cases, mostly when multiple comorbidities are present. A correct evaluation and management of the patient is essential to guarantee a good prognosis in this rare infection.',\n",
              " 'Since April 19, 2021, all persons aged =16 years in the United States have been eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. As of May 30, 2021, approximately one half of U.S. adults were fully vaccinated, with the lowest coverage and lowest reported intent to get vaccinated among young adults aged 18-39 years (1-4). To examine attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination and vaccination intent among adults in this age group, CDC conducted nationally representative household panel surveys during March-May 2021. Among respondents aged 18-39 years, 34.0% reported having received a COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 51.8% were already vaccinated or definitely planned to get vaccinated, 23.2% reported that they probably were going to get vaccinated or were unsure about getting vaccinated, and 24.9% reported that they probably or definitely would not get vaccinated. Adults aged 18-24 years were least likely to report having received a COVID-19 vaccine and were most likely to report being unsure about getting vaccinated or that they were probably going to get vaccinated. Adults aged 18-39 years with lower incomes, with lower educational attainment, without health insurance, who were non-Hispanic Black, and who lived outside of metropolitan areas had the lowest reported vaccination coverage and intent to get vaccinated. Concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness were the primary reported reasons for not getting vaccinated. Vaccination intent and acceptance among adults aged 18-39 years might be increased by improving confidence in vaccine safety and efficacy while emphasizing that vaccines are critical to prevent the spread of COVID-19 to friends and family and for resuming social activities (5).',\n",

However, the impact of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) on the respiratory microbiome is unknown.,Forty children were recruited through the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study, a longitudinal cohort followed from birth through early adolescence. Saliva and induced sputum were collected at age 14 years. Exposure to TRAP was characterized from birth through the time of sample collection using a previously validated land-use regression model. Sequencing of the bacterial 16S and ITS fungal rRNA genes was performed on sputum and saliva samples. The relative abundance of bacterial taxa and diversity indices were compared in children with exposure to high and low TRAP. We also used multiple linear regression to assess the effect of TRAP exposure, gender, asthma status, and socioeconomic status on the alpha diversity of bacteria in sputum.,We observed higher bacterial alpha diversity indices in sputum than in saliva. The diversity indices for bacteria were greater in the high TRAP exposure group than the low exposure group. These differences remained after adjusting for asthma status, gender, and mother's education. No differences were observed in the fungal microbiome between TRAP exposure groups.,Our findings indicate that exposure to TRAP in early childhood and adolescence may be associated with greater bacterial diversity in the lower respiratory tract. Asthma status does not appear to confound the observed differences in diversity. These results demonstrate that there may be a TRAP-exposure related change in the lower respiratory microbiota that is independent of asthma status.\",\n",
              " 'Resilience is important for people to maintain mental health after negative life-events. However, its longitudinal psychological and social predictors are poorly revealed. Based on the ecological system theory model, the current study aimed to determine the longitudinal temporal mechanism underlying the development of early-adulthood resilience using long-term (early-life trauma and personality), medium-term and short-term (life-events, social support, and depression) psychosocial predictors. A total of 505 university students were recruited at baseline (T1), 433 of whom took part in a three-year longitudinal investigation (T2). The results showed that at T1 and T2, the resilience scores of individuals were identically high (72.98 and 73.21, respectively). Pearson correlation analysis showed that early-adulthood resilience was negatively correlated with early-life trauma, psychoticism and neuroticism, depression, ad life-events, and positively correlated with extraversion, social-support, and resilience. Regression and structural equation models showed that extraversion had a direct positive effect on T1 resilience through the mediation of T1 life-events, depression, and social-support, while childhood emotional neglect (EN) had indirect negative effect and extraversion had direct positive effect on T2 resilience through the mediation of T1 resilience, and T2 depression and social-support. In conclusion, this study is among the first to reveal the longitudinal temporal process of the development of early-adulthood resilience using remote and adjacent psychosocial predictors. The findings confirm that childhood EN and extraversion have a remote impact on early-adulthood resilience through recent and current depression and social-support. Our results imply that early-life trauma does not hinder the development of early-adulthood resilience in a linear trend.',\n",
              " \"A key aspect in defining cell state is the complex choreography of DNA binding events in a given cell type, which in turn establishes a cell-specific gene-expression program. Here we wanted to take a deep analysis of DNA binding events and transcriptional output of a single cell state (K562 cells). To this end we re-analyzed 195 DNA binding proteins contained in ENCODE data. We used standardized analysis pipelines, containerization, and literate programming with R Markdown for reproducibility and rigor. Our approach validated many findings from previous independent studies, underscoring the importance of ENCODE's goals in providing these reproducible data resources. We also had several new findings including: (i) 1,362 promoters, which we refer to as 'reservoirs,' that are defined by having up to 111 different DNA binding-proteins localized on one promoter, yet do not have any expression of steady-state RNA (ii) Reservoirs do not overlap super-enhancer annotations and distinct have distinct properties from super-enhancers. (iii) The human specific SVA repeat element may have been co-opted for enhancer regulation and is highly transcribed in PRO-seq and RNA-seq. Collectively, this study performed by the students of a CU Boulder computational biology class (BCHM 5631 -Spring 2020) demonstrates the value of reproducible findings and how resources like ENCODE that prioritize data standards can foster new findings with existing data in a didactic environment.\",\n",
              " 'The distribution of multiscale pores and fractures in coal and rock is an important basis for reflecting the capacity of fluid flow in coal seam seepage passages. Accurate extraction and qualitative and quantitative analysis of pore-fracture structures are helpful in revealing the flow characteristics of fluid in seepage channels. The relationship between pore and fracture connectivity can provide a scientific reference for optimizing coal seam water injection parameters. Therefore, to analyse the change in permeability caused by the variability in the coal pore-fracture network structure, a CT scanning technique was used to scan coal samples from the Leijia District, Fuxin. A total of 720 sets of original images were collected, a median filter was used to filter out the noise in the obtained images, and to form the basis of a model, the reconstruction and analysis of the three-dimensional pore-fracture morphology of coal samples were carried out. A pore-fracture network model of the coal body was extracted at different scales. Using the maximum sphere algorithm combined with the coordination number, the effect of different quantitative relationships between pore size and pore throat channel permeability was studied. Avizo software was used to simulate the flow path of fluid in the seepage channels. The change trend of the fluid velocity between different seepage channels was discussed. The results of the pore-fracture network models at different scales show that the pore-fracture structure is nonuniform and vertically connected, and the pores are connected at connecting points. The pore size distribution ranges from 104 µm to 9425 µm. The pore throat channel length distribution ranges from 4206 µm to 48073 µm. The size of the coordination number determines the connectivity and thus the porosity of the coal seam. The more connected pore channels there are, the larger the pore diameters and the stronger the percolation ability. During flow in the seepage channels of the coal, the velocity range is divided into a low-speed region, medium-speed region and high-speed region. The fluid seepage in the coal seam is driven by the following factors: pore connectivity > pore and pore throat dimensions > pore and pore throat structure distribution. Ultimately, the pore radius and pore connectivity directly affect the permeability of the coal seam.',\n",

              " 'Dysregulation of cell morphology and cell-cell interaction results in cancer cell growth, migration, invasion, and metastasis. Besides, a balance between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) is required for cancer cell morphology and angiogenesis. Here, we determined gene signatures associated with the morphology and microenvironment of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) to enable prognosis prediction. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) on 31 PCNSL samples revealed gene signatures as follows: ACTA2, ACTR10, CAPG, CORO1C, KRT17, and PALLD in cytoskeleton, CDH5, CLSTN1, ITGA10, ITGAX, ITGB7, ITGA8, FAT4, ITGAE, CDH10, ITGAM, ITGB6, and CDH18 in adhesion, COL8A2, FBN1, LAMB3, and LAMA2 in ECM, ADAM22, ADAM28, MMP11, and MMP24 in MMP. Prognosis prediction formulas with the gene expression values and the Cox regression model clearly divided survival curves of the subgroups in each status. Furthermore, collagen genes contributed to gene network formation in glasso, suggesting that the ECM balance controls the PCNSL microenvironment. Finally, the comprehensive balance of morphology and microenvironment enabled prognosis prediction by a combinatorial expression of 8 representative genes, including KRT17, CDH10, CDH18, COL8A2, ADAM22, ADAM28, MMP11, and MMP24. Besides, these genes could also diagnose PCNSL cell types with MTX resistances in vitro. These results would not only facilitate the understanding of biology of PCNSL but also consider targeting pathways for anti-cancer treatment in personalized precision medicine in PCNSL.',\n",

This study examined the biting and resting preferences of the local insecticide-resistant vector populations few years following scale-up of anti-vector interventions.,Indoor and outdoor-resting Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes were collected between July and October 2019 from ten villages in five regions in The Gambia using pyrethrum spray collection (indoor) and prokopack aspirator from pit traps (outdoor). Polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to identify molecular species, insecticide resistance mutations, Plasmodium infection rate and host blood meal.,A total of 844 mosquitoes were collected both indoors (421, 49.9%) and outdoors (423, 50.1%). Four main vector species were identified, including An. arabiensis (indoor: 15%, outdoor: 26%); An. coluzzii (indoor: 19%, outdoor: 6%), An. gambiae s.s. (indoor: 11%, outdoor: 16%), An. melas (indoor: 2%, outdoor: 0.1%) and hybrids of An. coluzzii-An. gambiae s.s (indoors: 3%, outdoors: 2%). A significant preference for outdoor resting was observed in An. arabiensis (Pearson X2 = 22.7, df = 4, P<0.001) and for indoor resting in An. coluzzii (Pearson X2 = 55.0, df = 4, P<0.001). Prevalence of the voltage-gated sodium channel (Vgsc)-1014S was significantly higher in the indoor-resting (allele freq. = 0.96, 95%CI: 0.78-1, P = 0.03) than outdoor-resting (allele freq. = 0.82, 95%CI: 0.76-0.87) An. arabiensis population. For An. coluzzii, the prevalence of most mutation markers was higher in the outdoor (allele freq. = 0.92, 95%CI: 0.81-0.98) than indoor-resting (allele freq. = 0.78, 95%CI: 0.56-0.86) mosquitoes.

The overall sporozoite positivity rate was 1.3% (95% CI: 0.5-2%) in mosquito populations. Indoor-resting An. coluzzii had mainly fed on human blood while indoor-resting An. arabiensis fed on animal blood.,In this study, high levels of resistance mutations were observed that could be influencing the mosquito populations to rest indoors or outdoors. The prevalent animal-biting behaviour demonstrated in the mosquito populations suggest that larval source management could be an intervention to complement vector control in this setting.',\n",
              " 'Clubroot is one of the most serious diseases affecting Brassicaceae plants worldwide. However, there is no effective control method for clubroot. Salicylic acid (SA) is a plant hormone that plays a critical role in plant defense. In our study, we found the disease severity of a clubroot-sensitive cultivar of pakchoi, Xinxiaqing, was reduced with 0.6mM exogenous SA after the infection of P. brassicae. To investigate the mechanism of SA-reduced disease severity against clubroot, then we analyzed the plant growth, alteration of antioxidant enzyme system, and related gene expression of Xinxiaqing. Results showed that the clubroot incidence rate and disease index were decreased after being treated with 0.6 mM exogenous SA. Furthermore, plant growth, reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents, and membrane lipid peroxidation were changed. The activities of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbic acid-peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GR), were increased. Additionally, the production rates of malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and superoxide anion (O2·-) were also inhibited. The expression levels of genes, encoding SOD, APX, CAT, and GR, were increased. By summering all results, we conclude that 0.6 mM SA contributes to the reduction of disease severity to clubroot by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, abilities of osmotic regulation, and ROS scavenging to reduce the clubroot-induced damage in pakchoi.',\n",

We aim to assess trends in asymptomatic STIs following the publication of recommendations for STIs screening, i.e. Chlamydia (CT) and gonorrhea (NG). Seventeen centers located in the Paris area participated in the study. All asymptomatic HIV-infected MSM patients attending a follow up consultation were proposed to participated in the study. Asymptomatic patients were included over 2 periods: period 1 from April to December 2015 and period 2 from September to December 2017. Etiologic diagnosis of STIs including hepatitis B, C, syphilis, was performed using a serological test, including a non-treponemal titer with a confirmatory treponemal assay for syphilis. CT and NG were screened using a nucleic acid amplification test (NAATs) on 3 anatomical sites, i.e. urine, rectal and pharyngeal. Overall, 781 patients were included: 490 and 291 in periods 1 and 2 respectively. Asymptomatic CT, NG, and syphilis were diagnosed in 7.5%, 4.8% and, 4.2% respectively. The rate of patients having a multisite asymptomatic infection was 10.2% and 21.1% for CT and NG respectively. The most frequently involved anatomical sites for CT and NG asymptomatic infections were anorectal (66.1% and 55.2% respectively) and pharyngeal (47.4% and 60.5% respectively). CT and NG asymptomatic infection increased by 1.3- and 2-fold respectively between the two periods while syphilis decreased by 3 folds. Our results encourage to reconsider multisite screening for CT and NG in asymptomatic HIV positive MSM as the yield of screening urinary samples only might be low. Despite the more systematic STI screening of asymptomatic HIV positive MSM the prevalence of STI is increasing in MSM in France. Therefore, this strategy has not led to alter CT and NG transmission. The decrease of syphilis might involve self-medication by doxycycline, and the intensification of syphilis screening.',\n",
              " 'To investigate the influence of bedding structure and different loading rates on the dynamic fracture characteristics and energy dissipation of Datong coal, a split Hopkinson bar was used to obtain the fracture characteristics of coal samples with different bedding angles. The process of crack initiation and propagation in Datong coal was recorded by the high-speed camera. The formula for the model I fracture toughness of the transversely isotropic material is obtained on the basis of the finite element method (FEM) together with the J-integral. By comparing the incident energy, absorbed energy, fracture energy and residual kinetic energy of Datong coal samples under various impact speeds, the energy dissipation characteristics during the dynamic fracture process of coal considering the bedding structure is acquired. The experimental results indicate that the fracture pattern of notched semi-circular bending (NSCB) Datong coal is tensile failure. After splitting into two parts, the coal sample rotates approximately uniformly around the contact point between the sample and the incident rod. The dynamic fracture toughness is 3.52~8.64 times of the quasi-static fracture toughness for Datong coal. Dynamic fracture toughness increases with increasing impact velocity, and the effect of bedding angle on fracture toughness then decreases. In addition, the residual kinetic energy of coal samples with the same bedding angle increases with the increase of impact speed. The energy utilization rate decreases continuously, and the overall dispersion of statistical data decreases gradually. In rock fragmentation engineering, the optimum loading condition is low-speed loading regardless of energy utilization efficiency or fracture toughness. These conclusions may have significant implications for the optimization of hydraulic fracturing process in coal mass and the further understanding of crack propagation mechanisms in coalbed methane extraction (CME). The anisotropic effect of coal should be fully considered in both these cases.',\n",

Patients with greater cigarette smoke exposure had lower expiratory flow rates (FEV1, FEF50, FEF75, PEFR), DLCO, and maximum power output (MPO) during exercise. There was no association between smoke exposure and muscle strength. Modeling MPO (kpm/min) output as a function of demographic and physiologic variables showed that the data are well explained by muscle strength (kg), FEV1 (L), and DLCO (mmHg/min/mL) in similar magnitude (MPO = 42.7*Quads0.34*FEV10.34 * DLCO0.43; r = 0.84).,Long-term cigarette smoke exposure is associated with small airway narrowing and impaired diffusion capacity but not with peripheral muscle weakness. The effects of smoking, age, and gender on maximum power output are mediated by reductions in FEV1, muscle strength and DLCO. Exercise capacity in smokers may benefit from therapies targeting all 3 variables.',\n",

P-values in the multivariable analysis, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to determine the strength of association. P-value =0.05 was considered as significant.,Enterococci spp was isolated on 123/200 (61.50%) patients. Among these isolates, the incidence of vancomycin resistant Enterococci was 11.4% [95% CI: (6.0-17.0)]. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns against Enterococci showed highest rate of resistance to ampicillin (69.9%). Multidrug resistances were observed in 49.59% of Enterococci isolates. Study participants who had prior antibioticexposurer more than two weeks [AOR = 7.35; 95% CI: (1.2144.64)] and hospitalization for the last six months [AOR = 5.68; 95% CI: (1.09 29.74)] were significantly associated with vancomycin resistant Enterococci.,In our study high incidence of vancomycin resistant Enterococci was found. Previous exposure to antibiotics for more than two weeks and hospitalization for more than six months were significantly associated with vancomycin resistant Enterococci. The isolated Enterococci had variable degrees of resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics. Therefore, periodic surveillance on antimicrobial resistance pattern, adhering to rational use of antibiotics and implementing infection prevention protocols may reduce colonization by VRE.',\n",
              " 'Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) represents a global threat owing to its ability to resist most of the currently available antimicrobial agents. Moreover, emergence of carbapenem resistant A. baumannii (CR-AB) isolates limits the available treatment options. Enzymatic degradation by variety of ß-lactamases, have been identified as the most common mechanism of carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii. The alarming increase in the prevalence of CR-AB necessitates continuous screening and molecular characterization to appreciate the problem. The present study was performed to assess the prevalence and characterize carbapenemases among 206 CR-AB isolated from various clinical specimens collected from different intensive care units at Kasr Al-Aini Hospital. All isolates were confirmed to be A. baumannii by detection of the blaOXA-51-like gene. Molecular screening of 13 common Ambler class bla carbapenemases genes in addition to insertion sequence (IS-1) upstream OXA-23 were performed by using four sets of multiplex PCR, followed by identification using gene sequencing technology. Among the investigated genes, the prevalence of blaOXA-23, and blaOXA-58 were 77.7%, and 1.9%, respectively. The ISAba1 was detected in 10% of the blaOXA-23 positive isolates. The prevalence of metallo-ß-lactamases (MBLs) studied; blaNDM-1, blaSPM, blaVIM, blaSIM-1 were 11.7%, 6.3%, 0.5%, and 0.5% respectively. One of class A; bla KPC was detected in 10.7% of the investigated isolates. blaOXA-24/40, blaIMP, blaGES, blaVEB and blaGIM were not detected in any of the studied isolates. Moreover, 18.4% of the isolates have shown to harbor two or more of the screened bla genes. We concluded that the most prevalent type of ß-lactamases genes among CR-AB isolates collected from Egyptian patients were blaOXA-23 followed by blaNDM-1 and blaKPC.',\n",
              " 'Patients with diabetes are at a high risk for developing cardiac dysfunction in the absence of coronary artery disease or hypertension, a condition known as diabetic cardiomyopathy. Contributing to heart failure is the presence of diabetic kidney disease. The Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat is a non-obese, non-hypertensive model of type 2 diabetes that, like humans, shares a susceptibility locus on chromosome 10. Herein, we perform a detailed analysis of cardio-renal remodeling and response to renin angiotensin system blockade in GK rats to ascertain the validity of this model for further insights into disease pathogenesis.,Study 1: Male GK rats along with age matched Wistar control animals underwent longitudinal assessment of cardiac and renal function for 32 weeks (total age 48 weeks). Animals underwent regular echocardiography every 4 weeks and at sacrifice, early (~24 weeks) and late (~48 weeks) timepoints, along with pressure volume loop analysis. Histological and molecular characteristics were determined using standard techniques. Study 2: the effect of renin angiotensin system (RAS) blockade upon cardiac and renal function was assessed in GK rats. Finally, proteomic studies were conducted in vivo and in vitro to identify novel pathways involved in remodeling responses.,GK rats developed hyperglycaemia by 12 weeks of age (p<0.01 c/w Wistar controls). Echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function demonstrated preserved systolic function by 48 weeks of age. Invasive studies demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary congestion and impaired diastolic function. Renal function was preserved with evidence of hyperfiltration. Cardiac histological analysis demonstrated myocyte hypertrophy (p<0.05) with evidence of significant interstitial fibrosis (p<0.05). RT qPCR demonstrated activation of the fetal gene program, consistent with cellular hypertrophy. RAS blockade resulted in a reduction blood pressure(P<0.05) cardiac interstitial fibrosis (p<0.05) and activation of fetal gene program. No significant change on either systolic or diastolic function was observed, along with minimal impact upon renal structure or function. Proteomic studies demonstrated significant changes in proteins involved in oxidative phosp4horylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, beta-oxidation, and PI3K/Akt signalling (all p<0.05). Further, similar changes were observed in both LV samples from GK rats and H9C2 cells incubated in high glucose media.,By 48 weeks of age, the diabetic GK rat demonstrates evidence of preserved systolic function and impaired relaxation, along with cardiac hypertrophy, in the presence of hyperfiltration and elevated protein excretion. These findings suggest the GK rat demonstrates some, but not all features of diabetes induced cardiorenal syndrome. This has implications for the use of this model to assess preclinical strategies to treat cardiorenal disease.',\n",
              " \"Opposing genetic and cultural-social explanations for the origin of language are currently the focus of much discussion. One of the functions linked to the longitudinal fascicle is language, which links Wernicke's area and Broca's area in the brain, and its size should indicate the brain increase in the evolution. Sapajus is a New World primate genus with high cognition and advanced tool use similar to that of chimpanzees. A study of the gross anatomy of the longitudinal fascicle of Sapajus using Kingler's method found it to differ from other studied primates, such as macaques and chimpanzees, mainly because its fibers join the cingulate fascicle. As in other non-human primates, the longitudinal fascicle of Sapajus does not reach the temporal lobe, which could indicate a way of separating these fascicles to increase white matter in relation to individual function. The study of anatomical structures seems very promising for understanding the basis of the origin of language. Indeed, socio-historical-cultural philosophy affirms the socio-cultural origin of speech, although considering the anatomical structures behind it working as a functional system.\",\n",
              " 'Probiotics are health beneficial bacterial populations colonizing the human gut and skin. Probiotics are believed to be involved in immune system regulation, gut microbiota stabilization, prevention of infectious diseases, and adjustments of host metabolic activities. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium affect glycemic levels, blood lipids, and protein metabolism. However, the interactions between probiotics and metabolic diseases as well as the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We used streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic animal models to study the effect of ProbiogluTM, a multi-strain probiotic supplement including Lactobaccilus salivarius subsp. salicinius AP-32, L. johnsonii MH-68, L. reuteri GL-104, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CP-9, on the regulation of physiochemical parameters related to type-2 diabetes. Experimental rats were randomly assigned into five groups, control group, streptozotocin (STZ)-treated rats (STZ group), STZ + 1× ProbiogluTM group, STZ + 5× ProbiogluTM group, and STZ + 10× ProbiogluTM group, and physiological data were measured at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Our results indicate that supplementation with ProbiogluTM significantly improved glucose tolerance, glycemic levels, insulin levels, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Furthermore, we observed reduction in urea and blood lipid levels, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG), and total cholesterol (TC). ProbiogluTM administration increased the ß-cell mass in STZ-induced diabetic animal models, whereas it reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1ß. In addition, the enhancement of oxidative stress biomarkers and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities was associated with a decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. We conclude that ProbiogluTM attenuates STZ-induced type-2 diabetes by protecting ß-cells, stabilizing glycemic levels, and reducing inflammation. Among all probiotic treating groups, the 10×ProbiogluTM treatment revealed the best results. However, these experimental results still need to be validated by different animal models of type-2 diabetes and human clinical trials in the future.',\n",
              " 'In light of the role that airborne transmission plays in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the ongoing high global mortality from well-known airborne diseases such as tuberculosis and measles, there is an urgent need for practical ways of identifying congregate spaces where low ventilation levels contribute to high transmission risk. Poorly ventilated clinic spaces in particular may be high risk, due to the presence of both infectious and susceptible people. While relatively simple approaches to estimating ventilation rates exist, the approaches most frequently used in epidemiology cannot be used where occupancy varies, and so cannot be reliably applied in many of the types of spaces where they are most needed.,The aim of this study was to demonstrate the use of a non-steady state method to estimate the absolute ventilation rate, which can be applied in rooms where occupancy levels vary. We used data from a room in a primary healthcare clinic in a high TB and HIV prevalence setting, comprising indoor and outdoor carbon dioxide measurements and head counts (by age), taken over time. Two approaches were compared: approach 1 using a simple linear regression model and approach 2 using an ordinary differential equation model.,The absolute ventilation rate, Q, using approach 1 was 2407 l/s [95% CI: 1632-3181] and Q from approach 2 was 2743 l/s [95% CI: 2139-4429].,We demonstrate two methods that can be used to estimate ventilation rate in busy congregate settings, such as clinic waiting rooms. Both approaches produced comparable results, however the simple linear regression method has the advantage of not requiring room volume measurements. These methods can be used to identify poorly-ventilated spaces, allowing measures to be taken to reduce the airborne transmission of pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, measles, and SARS-CoV-2.',\n",
              " 'As the global burden of dementia increases, the absence of treatment underscores the need for identification of factors that may improve cognitive reserve-the ability to stave off cognitive decline in old age. The beneficial association between musical instrument engagement and episodic memory has been identified in children, young adults, and older adults. Yet, previous studies in musical instrument engagement have rarely examined the potential for adolescence and adulthood exposures to independently improve cognition, nor have they been linked with the rate of memory decline over time in older adults. We investigated whether adolescent musical instrument engagement and continued musical instrument engagement over the adult life course were separately associated with higher episodic memory, as well as rate of decline in a large longitudinal cohort.,Data were from a prospective cohort of high school graduates from 1957. High school music engagement (HSME) was ascertained through graduate yearbooks and assessed as membership in musical performance groups. A questionnaire was used to assess musical engagement through adulthood (MEA) at ages 35, 55, and 65. The episodic memory score was composed of immediate and delayed recall task scores, and was assessed when participants were aged approximately 65 and 72 years old among 5,718 individuals. Linear mixed models were used to assess the association between music, and memory performance and decline over time.,Of high school graduates who participated in the study, 38.1% played music in high school, and 21.1% played music in adulthood. While musical engagement was more common in those who played in childhood, 40% of those who played continuously as an adult did not play in high school. High HSME (B = 0.348, p = 0.049) and continuous MEA (B = 0.424, p = 0.012) were associated with higher memory scores at age 65 after covariate adjustment. When examining memory decline, the benefits of high HSME decreased over time (B = -0.435, p = 0.048), while the rate of decline did not differ between MEA groups. Exploratory models revealed differential benefits for HSME and immediate recall, and MEA and delayed recall.,This study provides further evidence that musical engagement in childhood or adulthood is associated with non-musical cognitive reserve. These two exposures may act differentially in different domains of episodic memory. Further work is needed to determine the relationship between musicianship and the rate of cognitive decline.',\n",
              " 'Annually, approximately 15 million babies are born preterm (<37 weeks gestational age) globally. In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) environment, infants are exposed to repeated stressful or painful procedures as part of routine lifesaving care. These procedures have been associated with epigenetic alterations that may lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Telomere length has been negatively associated with adverse life experiences in studies of adults.,This pilot study aimed to describe telomere length in a sample of preterm infants at NICU discharge and examine any associations with pain, feeding method, and neurodevelopment.,This descriptive pilot study sample includes baseline absolute telomere length (aTL) of 36 preterm infants immediately prior to discharge. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine aTL. Infant demographics, pain/stress, type of feeding, antibiotic use, neurodevelopment, and buccal swab data were collected. Descriptive data analysis was used to describe the telomere length using graphs.,Among our preterm infant samples, the mean aTL was far greater than the average adult telomere length. Although no significant associations were found between aTL and pain, feeding method, and neurodevelopment, a trend between sex was noted where male telomere lengths were shorter than females as they aged.,This is one of few studies to evaluate preterm infant telomere length. Although other researchers have used relative telomere length, we used the more accurate aTL. We found nonsignificant shorter telomere lengths among males. Additional large-scale, longitudinal studies are needed to better identify the predictors of telomere length at the time of discharge from NICU.',\n",
              " 'Among Black Americans, interpersonal racial discrimination is common. Stress, including following discrimination, contributes to pregnancy complications. In this secondary analysis, we provide data on associations among discrimination, stress, and their interaction across the life course and inflammation, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms during pregnancy.,During the early third trimester, Black American women (n = 93) completed the Experiences of Discrimination Scale, the Stress and Adversity Inventory, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Inventory. Plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), and IL-ß levels were quantified. Associations were examined by linear regression, controlling for demographic, behavioral, and clinical covariates.,Associations among racial discrimination and plasma IL-8, TNF-a, and IL-ß levels depended upon average ratings of life course stress. When stress was low, discrimination in the mid tertile was associated with the highest levels of IL-8, TNF-a, and IL-ß. Subscale analyses suggested that findings related to IL-8 were driven by chronic stress whereas findings related to TNF-a and IL-ß were driven by acute stress. When examined together, greater discrimination but not greater life course stress was associated with higher prenatal perceived stress. In subscale analyses, the association between discrimination and prenatal perceived stress depended upon average ratings of life course acute stress. When acute stress was low, discrimination in the midtertile was associated with the highest levels of prenatal perceived stress. When acute stress was high, discrimination in the high tertile was associated with the highest levels of prenatal perceived stress. There were also direct associations among greater life course chronic stress, prenatal perceived stress, and prenatal depressive symptoms. Associations were attenuated when discrimination was included as a covariate.,The current analyses suggest that, among Black Americans, prenatal inflammation, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms may be shaped by racial discrimination and stress across the life course. In many cases, associations among discrimination and prenatal parameters depended upon how stressful exposures to life course stressors had been rated. The data suggest the potential for adaptive plasticity under some stress and highlight the deleterious nature of compounding stress.',\n",
              " 'Patterns of food security persistently vary by race, yet limited research has examined how community-specific experiences of race and racism are associated with nutritional outcomes.,This analysis describes a novel approach for classifying experiences of race and racism and explores the relationship between identified classes and measures of food security and diet quality.,Cross-sectional self-reported survey data from 306 African American adults living in two urban midwestern cities were collected in 2017-2018. Measures of racialized experiences assessed consciousness of race, perceived discrimination, and health effects of perceived discrimination. Food security was measured with a six-item screener and diet quality with the Healthy Eating Index-2010. Latent class analysis was used to generate racialized classes. Bivariate analyses were conducted to examine differences in class membership by sociodemographics and nutrition outcomes.,Participants were majority women who were receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. Three racialized classes were identified: Class 1 reported few racialized experiences (42.8% of the sample), Class 2 was racially conscious with few experiences of discrimination (45.1%), and Class 3 was both racially conscious and affected by racialized actions (12.1%). Racialized classes were significantly different in mean household income, level of education, home ownership, and job loss in the past year. Class 3 was the least represented among those that were food secure and the most represented among those that were very low food secure. There were no differences by class in Healthy Eating Index-2010 scores.,Findings offer an innovative method for measuring exposures to racism and for assessing its relationship to food security. Findings highlight heterogeneity of racialized experiences in similar contexts as well as potential root cause targets such as wages, education, home ownership, and employment that may be modulated to mitigate the effects of racism on food insecurity.',\n",
              " \"Southeast Asian women have high rates of cervical cancer and yet are among the least likely to be screened. There is sparse literature on communication patterns among Southeast Asian women, specifically related to cervical cancer and Pap test uptake. Little is known about the influence of Southeast Asian mothers and daughters on each other's cervical cancer beliefs and screening behaviors.,We examined the perceptions of and barriers to cervical cancer screening among Cambodian and Lao mothers and daughters and explored how they converse about women's health issues, specifically cervical cancer and Pap testing.,We conducted in-depth interviews with Cambodian and Lao mother-daughter dyads, aged 18 years and older, living in a large Midwestern city between February and September of 2015. Descriptive statistics were calculated to summarize the sample demographic characteristics. Bivariate tests (contingency table analyses, independent t-tests, and Pearson correlations) were conducted to test for differences between the mothers and daughters in demographic characteristics and measures of health status and beliefs. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis.,In-depth interviews were conducted with three Cambodian and eight Lao mother-daughter dyads. The daughters were significantly more acculturated to English, had greater education, and were mostly employed full time. The mothers and daughters evaluated their health status much the same, their medical mistrust equally, and all of the mothers and nine of the daughters were Buddhist. Themes in mother-daughter communication included what mothers and daughters do and do not talk about with regard to sexual health, refugee experiences, what hinders mother-daughter communication, and relationship dynamics. The mothers were embarrassed and uncomfortable discussing cervical cancer, Pap testing, and other women's health issues with their daughters. Although mothers did not influence women's health promotion or cervical cancer prevention with their daughters, daughters did influence their mothers' health and healthcare decisions. Daughters were critical in navigating healthcare systems, engaging with providers, and making medical decisions on behalf of their mothers.,By leveraging the unique and dynamic intergenerational bond that mothers and daughters who identify as Southeast Asian have, we can develop strategies to influence the cultural dialogue related to cervical cancer and early detection.\",\n",
              " 'Although stress is an established contributor to obesity (in general population studies), mechanisms to explain this association in African American women that incorporate culturally relevant frameworks have received little attention.,To investigate how stress is associated with body mass index (BMI) in this population, we examined multivariate models of BMI predicted by race-related, gender-related, and generic stressful life events and by use of food to cope with stress. We hypothesized that the three types of stressful life events would be indirectly associated with BMI through using food to cope with stress.,Psychometrically robust measures were included in surveys administered to a socioeconomically diverse sample of 189 African American women aged 21-78 years. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. We examined race-related, gender-related, and generic stressful life events as latent constructs indicated by exposure to and appraisal of potential stressors predicting a mediator, using food to cope, which predicted BMI; this model also included direct paths from the three latent stressful life event constructs to BMI.,Almost every participant reported using food in some way to cope with stress; 33% and 42% met established criteria for overweight and obesity, respectively. The race-related stressful life event construct was the only latent construct predicting using food to cope with stress, and using food to cope with stress predicted BMI. A significance test of indirect effects demonstrated that the race-related stressful life event construct was indirectly associated with BMI through the mediator, using food to cope.,Culturally relevant stress exposures and stress-related eating are important areas of foci for tackling overweight, obesity, and related health inequities in African American women. Findings highlight the importance of developing more complex models to understand the stress-related factors that elevate risk for overweight and obesity in this population.',\n",

The baseline sample included 1,903 adults, with a trajectory subsample of 427 who completed 3-month assessments across 3 years. Hierarchical (sequential) forward multivariable regression, covarying for participant characteristics, was conducted to determine the association between self-efficacy and patient characteristics on pain outcomes. Trajectory models, covarying for participant characteristics, were used to examine changes in self-efficacy and pain outcomes across time and whether self-efficacy mediated the pain trajectories.,Mean time since diagnosis was 9.5 years, with 39.2% diagnosed with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis. Greater self-efficacy was associated with less pain interference and intensity. Increasing age, female gender, finger ulcers, and small joint contractures were related to greater pain interference and intensity. Esophageal gastrointestinal symptoms were associated with more pain interference. Self-efficacy and pain trajectories remained stable across time, and self-efficacy did not mediate the pain trajectories.,This study identified self-efficacy, age, gender, finger ulcers, small joint contractures, and esophageal gastrointestinal symptoms as important correlates associated with pain in patients with systemic sclerosis. In addition, this study found that self-efficacy and pain outcomes remained stable over time, providing important insights into the longitudinal pain experiences of patients with systemic sclerosis.',\n",
              " 'Racism is a significant source of toxic stress and a root cause of health inequities. Emerging evidence suggests that exposure to vicarious racism (i.e., racism experienced by a caregiver) is associated with poor child health and development, but associations with biological indicators of toxic stress have not been well studied. It is also unknown whether two-generation interventions, such as early home visiting programs, may help to mitigate the harmful effects of vicarious racism.,The purpose of this study was to examine associations between maternal experiences of racial discrimination and child indicators of toxic stress and to test whether relationships are moderated by prior participation in Minding the Baby (MTB), an attachment-based early home visiting intervention.,Ninety-seven maternal-child dyads (n = 43 intervention dyads, n = 54 control dyads) enrolled in the MTB Early School Age follow-up study. Mothers reported on racial discrimination using the Experiences of Discrimination Scale. Child indicators of toxic stress included salivary biomarkers of inflammation (e.g., C-reactive protein, panel of pro-inflammatory cytokines), body mass index, and maternally reported child behavioral problems. We used linear regression to examine associations between maternal experiences of racial discrimination and child indicators of toxic stress and included an interaction term between experiences of discrimination and MTB group assignment (intervention vs. control) to test moderating effects of the MTB intervention.,Mothers identified as Black/African American (33%) and Hispanic/Latina (64%). In adjusted models, maternal experiences of racial discrimination were associated with elevated salivary interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-a levels in children, but not child body mass index or behavior. Prior participation in the MTB intervention moderated the relationship between maternal experiences of discrimination and child interleukin-6 levels.,Results of this study suggest that racism may contribute to the biological embedding of early adversity through influences on inflammation, but additional research with serum markers is needed to better understand this relationship. Improved understanding of the relationships among vicarious racism, protective factors, and childhood toxic stress is necessary to inform family and systemic-level intervention.',\n",

              " 'Exposure to racism and associated adversities, such as poverty, is hypothesized to contribute to racial inequities in health via stress and immune pathways. Furthermore, the effects of adversity may be more salient during sensitive developmental periods. Our study examined racial differences in stress and immune biomarkers during adolescence and the effects of exposure to economic adversity at distinct developmental time periods and cumulatively in accounting for potential racial differences.,Secondary analysis of the Adolescent Health and Development in Context study was conducted. Data were derived from self-administered surveys; interviews; smartphone-based, geographic-explicit ecological momentary assessment; stress biomarkers (evening salivary cortisol over six nights and hair cortisol); and immune biomarkers (salivary shedding of Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] DNA among EBV-positive adolescents). Current socioeconomic status measures included annual household income and caregiver education. Caregivers also reported experiences of bankruptcy, difficulty paying bills, receipt of food stamps/Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program/electronic benefit transfer, and job loss when the child was of ages birth-5 years, 6-10 years, and 11 years or older. An affirmative response to any item was defined as exposure to economic adversity for that developmental time period (yes/no). A cumulative economic adversity measure was calculated as the sum of exposures across developmental periods (0 = never exposed to 3 = exposed across all time periods). Descriptive and multivariable regression analyses were conducted, accounting for covariates.,Black/African American adolescents had higher salivary cortisol concentration, higher hair cortisol concentration, and an increased odd of salivary shedding of EBV DNA compared to White adolescents. Racial differences were not attenuated by the current socioeconomic status or economic adversity (developmental period or cumulatively).,Our study provides evidence that stress and immune biomarkers differ by race as early as adolescence and may be one pathway through which racism and associated adversities contribute to racial health inequities. Further research on the contribution of multiple adversities beyond poverty to racial inequities in physiological stress and health is critical for informing effective prevention and intervention efforts.',\n",

Offering HIV screening to key populations in emergency departments (EDs) is a strategy that has been demonstrated to be effective. Analyzing patient and provider perceptions of such screening can help identify implementation facilitators and barriers.,The aim of this study was to investigate the acceptability of offering nurse-driven HIV screening to key populations based on data collected from patients, nurses, and other service providers.,This convergent mixed-methods study was a substudy of a cluster-randomized two-period crossover trial conducted in eight EDs to evaluate the effectiveness of the screening strategy. During the DICI-VIH (Dépistage Infirmier CIblé du VIH) trial, questionnaires were distributed to patients aged 18-64 years. Based on their responses, nurses offered screening to members of key populations.Over 5 days during the intervention period in four EDs, 218 patients were secondarily questioned about the acceptability of screening. Nurses completed 271 questionnaires pre- and posttrial regarding acceptability in all eight EDs. Descriptive analyses were conducted on these quantitative data. Convenience and purposeful sampling was used to recruit 53 providers to be interviewed posttrial. Two coders conducted a directed qualitative content analysis of the interview transcripts independently.,The vast majority of patients (95%) were comfortable with questions asked to determine membership in key populations and agreed (89%) that screening should be offered to key populations in EDs. Nurses mostly agreed that offering screening to key populations was well accepted by patients (62.2% pretrial and 71.4% posttrial), was easy to implement, and fell within the nursing sphere of competence. Pretrial, 73% of the nurses felt that such screening could be implemented in EDs. Posttrial, the proportion was 41%. Three themes emerged from the interviews: preference for targeted screening and a written questionnaire to identify key populations, facilitators of long-term implementation, and implementation barriers. Nurses were favorable to such screening provided specific conditions were met regarding training, support, collective involvement, and flexibility of application to overcome organizational and individual barriers.,Screening for key populations was perceived as acceptable and beneficial by patients and providers. Addressing the identified facilitators and barriers would help increase screening implementation in EDs.',\n",

T2DM is known to be associated with low testosterone. There is a paucity of data on the risk factors of hypogonadism in Nigerian men with T2DM. The objective of this study was to determine the clinical and biochemical correlates of hypogonadism and clinical predictors of low total testosterone levels in men with T2DM.,this was a cross-sectional study consisting of 358 men with T2DM and 179 non-diabetic men (controls). Structured Androgen Deficiency in the Ageing Male questionnaire was administered. Clinical and biochemical parameters were measured. Free testosterone was calculated from albumin, SHBG and total testosterone using Vermeulen´s method. Hypogonadism was defined as fasting TT as < 8 nmol/L with or without symptoms or TT of 8-12 nmol/L with symptoms of androgen deficiency. Low testosterone was defined as serum total testosterone levels = 12 nmol/L.,the mean (±SD) total testosterone of men with T2DM and controls were 8.79±3.35 nmol/L and 15.41±3.79 nmol/L respectively (p < 0.001). The risk of hypogonadism was associated with central obesity (Odds ratio [OR] 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-13.07), systolic hypertension (OR 3.93, 95% CI 0.67-23.10), hyperglycaemia (OR 2.48, 95% CI 0.37-16.46) and hypercholesterolaemia (OR 2.50, 95% CI 0.43-14.61).

We sought to evaluate adherence of the Beninese people to these preventive measures, in order to identify predictors of poor adherence and adapt the national response to COVID-19.,two consecutive online surveys were conducted between May and August 2020. Four hundred and sixty two and 507 adult participants aged 18 years and above responded to the first and second survey respectively, with >70% being males.,more than 98% of respondents reported wearing face masks. A five-point adherence score was constituted by scoring observance to key preventive measures (mask use, physical distancing, hand hygiene, coughing hygiene and avoiding to touch one´s face). We observed that the mean adherence scores were fairly stable over time, respectively 4.08 and 4.03 during the first and second survey (p=0.439). Increasing age (aOR=1.043, 95% CI: 1.026 - 1.061; p<0.001) and obtaining COVID-19 information from official sources (aOR=1.628, 95% CI: 1.275 - 2.081; p<0.001) were significantly associated with higher adherence scores in a multivariable model.,these findings suggest that a wide dissemination of adequate information about COVID-19 would increase adherence, and that targeted efforts should be directed towards increasing the compliance to preventive measures among the younger age groups.',\n",

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platforms performing this quantification and adaptable to intermediate laboratories have been developed. Thus, this study was conducted to evaluate the on-site performance of the AMPLIX® hepatitis B virus (HBV) real-time PCR technique in comparison with the COBAS AmpliPrep™ technique.,performance of the AMPLIX® HBV real-time PCR technique was evaluated with repeatability and intermediate precision (reproducibility) determined. The comparison with COBAS Taqman was performed by testing, in parallel, 42 plasma samples. The statistical analysis using Meth Val® software was focused on correlation and concordance determination.,AMPLIX® real-time PCR assay showed good reproducibility for the low (CV=6.65%) and high (CV=3.15%) control levels but also good repeatability for both the low (CV=2.12%) and high (CV=1.60%) concentration levels. Accuracy obtained in our study were less than acceptability limit fixed to 5%. Viral load measurements between Amplix and COBAS Taqman correlated strongly with a correlation coefficient of 0.97%. Concordance analysis gave an average of the differences of 0.54 log IU/L between the viral load measurements of the 2 techniques.,based on these results, the Amplix real-time PCR platform for the quantification of HBV DNA can be considered as a reliable system for the monitoring of chronic hepatitis B and also a system adapted to intermediate laboratories.',\n",

In March 2020, even before the first case of COVID-19 was registered, some African countries implemented total lockdown measures, which limited movement of people, banned mass gatherings, and closed schools and borders. However, these control measures, which affect individuals and society's well-being, cannot be implemented for a long time. There is an urgent need for a robust framework to guide African countries to make evidence-based decisions on easing these restrictive measures and reapply them when the infection rates increase significantly. This article presents a proposed framework to guide lockdown easing while limiting the community spread of COVID-19 in Africa. Due to lack of information on the impact of relaxing restrictions on peoples' movement on the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19) and how businesses will respond, it is almost clear that there is no single grand lockdown exit strategy. African governments should develop flexible, iterative lockdown exit plans based on epidemiological disease data, economic indicators, and peoples' views to inform decisions, all of which are paramount for success. A phased approach of changes and willingness to adapt methods will allow governments to minimize the pandemic's adverse impact and respond accordingly as new control tools become available.\",\n",

Tenofovir-based pre-exposure prophylaxis (TFV-PrEP) has been shown to reduce HIV infections in other key populations. However, comprehensive evidence regarding TFV-PrEP effectiveness in women living in SSA has not been determined. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review to determine the effectiveness of tenofovir-1% (TFV-1%) vaginal gel, oral tenofovir (TFV) and tenofovir-emtricitabine (TDF-FTC) pre-exposure prophylaxis for primary acquisition of HIV in at-risk women living in SSA.,from 2002 non-duplicate articles, four RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of one or more of the interventions against placebos were included. TFV-1% vaginal gel, oral TDF or TDF-FTC were not effective in preventing the acquisition of HIV infection in women living in SSA. However, poor adherence by study participants could have confounded the true effectiveness of TFV-PrEP in this high risk population.

This study assessed the proportion of appropriate antibiotic therapy recommendations using a novel paediatric RDT-guided treatment algorithm compared with standard care (SC) in paediatric bacteraemia.,This was a retrospective, observational study of admitted paediatric patients who received antibiotics for RDT-confirmed bacteraemia. Appropriateness of SC was compared with algorithm-recommended treatment. Antimicrobial appropriateness was defined as in vitro susceptibility to the organism identified through traditional microbiology. Clinical appropriateness took into consideration the ability to tailor therapy within 12 h of RDT results. Appropriateness was evaluated by two blinded, independent reviewers.,Eighty-six blood cultures were included with 15 unique Gram-positive and Gram-negative species or genus identified. Comparative antimicrobial appropriateness of SC and algorithm-recommended treatment was 94.2% (81/86) and 100% (86/86), respectively (P = 0.06).

Our results showed that PS-NPs caused dose-dependent adverse effects on energy reserves, membrane lipid metabolism, purine metabolism and lysosomal hydrolases. Exposure to PS-NPs reduced energy reserves, especially lipids. Membrane lipid metabolism was sensitive to PS-NPs with contents of phosphocholines (PC), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) and phosphatidylserines (PS) increasing and degradation being inhibited in all concentrations. High concentrations of PS-NPs altered the purine metabolism via increasing contents of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and adenine, which may be needed for DNA repair, and consuming inosine and hypoxanthine. During exposure to low concentrations of PS-NPs, lysosomal hydrolases in S. constricta, especially cathepsins, were inhibited while this influence was improved transitorily in 5\\xa0mg/L of PS-NPs. These adverse effects together impacted energy metabolism in S. constricta and disturbed energy homeostasis, which was manifested by the low levels of acetyl-CoA in high concentrations of PS-NPs. Overall, our results revealed the effects of acute exposure to gradient concentrations of PS-NPs on S. constricta, especially its metabolic process, and provide perspectives for understanding the toxicity of dynamic plastic pollution to coastal organisms and ecosystem.',\n",

Here, we assess the effects of the rhizospheric Pseudomonas inoculant strain RWX31 on the root exudate profile of the duckweed Spirodela polyrrhiza, using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Compared to untreated plants, inoculation with RWX31 specifically induced the exudation of two sterols, stigmasterol and ß-sitosterol. An authentic standard assay revealed that stigmasterol significantly promoted nitrogen removal and biofilm formation by the denitrifying bacterial strain RWX31, whereas ß-sitosterol had no effect. Assays for denitrifying enzyme activity were conducted to show that stigmasterol stimulated nitrogen removal by targeting nitrite reductase in bacteria. Enhanced N removal from water by stigmasterol, and a synergistic stimulatory effect with RWX31, was observed in open duckweed cultivation systems. We suggest that this is linked to a modulation of community composition of nirS- and nirK-type denitrifying bacteria in the rhizosphere, with a higher abundance of Bosea, Rhizobium, and Brucella, and a lower abundance of Rubrivivax. Our findings provide important new insights into the interaction of duckweed with the rhizospheric bacterial strain RWX31 and their involvement in the aquatic N cycle and offer a new path toward more effective bio-formulations for the purification of N-polluted waters.\",\n",

This study investigated the effect of arsenic (sodium arsenite) on post-gastrulated zebrafish embryos and elucidated effects of bimodal concentration-responses on different phenotypic perturbations. Six hour post fertilized (hpf) zebrafish embryos were exposed to arsenic to 96 hpf. Hatching success, mortality, and morphometric endpoints were evaluated both in embryos with chorions and dechorionated embryos. Zebrafish embryos exhibited a bimodal response to arsenic exposure. Concentration-response curves for exposed embryos with intact chorions had an initial peak in mortality (88%) at 1.33\\xa0mM arsenic, followed by a decrease in toxicity (~20% mortality) at 1.75\\xa0mM, and subsequently peaked to 100% mortality at higher concentrations. To account for the bimodal response, two distinct concentration-response curves were generated with estimated LC10 values (and 95% CI) of 0.462 (0.415, 0.508) mM and 1.69 (1.58, 1.78) mM for the 'low concentration' and 'high concentration' peaks, respectively. Other phenotypic analyses, including embryo length, yolk and pericardial edema all produced similar concentration-response patterns. Tests with dechorionated embryos also resulted in a bimodal toxicity response but with lower LC10 values of 0.170 (0.120, 0.220) mM and 0.800 (0.60, 0842) mM, respectively. Similarities in bimodal concentration-responses between with-chorion and dechorionated embryos indicate that the observed effect was not caused by the chorion limiting arsenic availability, thus lending support to other studies such as those that hypothesized a conserved bimodal mechanism of arsenic interference with nuclear receptor activation.\",\n",
              " 'The morphological anomalies of the early development stages of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, caused by exposure to environmental stressors, are used as biomarker in ecotoxicological and ecological investigations. Here, we reviewed the available literature and classified the embryo and larval anomalies identified so far, to highlight potential commonalities or differences related to the biological action of the different stressors and their ecological impact. Morphological anomalies are influenced by a) the developmental stage of exposure to stressors; b) the intensity of the stress; c) the intra- and inter-cellular mechanisms affected by the exposure to environmental agents. The classification and analysis of embryo and larvae anomalies, either observed by the authors of this review and reported in literature, indicate that sea urchin abnormalities, caused by exposure to different stressors, can be very similar among them and classified into 18 main types, which can occur individually or mixed. All anomalies can be used to calculate an Index of Contaminant Impact to assess the impact of multiple stressors and to identify relationships between morphological anomalies and compromised biological mechanisms. This approach could be useful for a first screening of the presence of potential stressors impairing the growth and development of the early life stages of marine organisms, thus providing a relevant advancement for in future monitoring activities devoted to assess the health status in coastal marine ecosystems.',\n",
              " 'Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) has been reported to be closely related to cardiovascular adverse events. However, the underlying mode of action remains to be elucidated. Previous studies have documented that PM induces mitochondrial damage and inflammation, the relation between these two biological outcomes is still unclear though. In this study, we used EA.hy926 human vascular endothelial cells and a standard PM, PM SRM1648a to study the potential effects of mitochondrial dysfunction on endothelial inflammatory responses. As a result, PM SRM1648a changes mitochondrial morphology and interrupts mitochondrial dynamics with a persistent tendency of fission in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, the caspase-1/IL-1ß axis is involved in inflammatory responses but not cell pyroptosis in EA.hy926\\xa0cells following the exposure to PM SRM1648a. The activation of caspase-1 has implications in inflammation but not pyroptosis, because caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis is not the main modality of cell death in PM SRM1648a-treated EA.hy926\\xa0cells. With regard to the association between mitochondrial damage and inflammation in the case of particle stimulation, DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission is responsible for inflammatory responses as a result of caspase-1 activation. The current study showed that PM SRM1648a has the ability to disturb mitochondrial dynamics, and trigger endothelial inflammation via DRP1/caspase-1/IL-1ß regulatory pathway. In a conclusion, mitochondrial fission enables EA.hy926\\xa0cells to facilitate caspase-1 activation in response to PM SRM1648a, which is a crucial step for inflammatory reaction in vascular endothelial cells.',\n",
              " 'There has been a worldwide interest in renewable energy technologies, as a means of decreasing reliance on fossil fuels, minimizing climate change effects, and reducing greenhouse emissions. One such technology is geothermal heating where the constant subsurface temperature is used to cool or heat building interiors via heat pumps. In Canada, the use of geothermal heating has become a popular option for heating and cooling buildings, and it is anticipated that, in the near term, most large buildings will include geothermal heating as part of their climate control strategy. However, little is known about the environmental impacts of geothermal heating on the subsurface environment. The present review will examine the effect of geothermal heating on groundwater flow and remediation efforts, whereby the heat generated by geothermal systems may help with urban pollution. Geothermal Remediation could leverage the subsurface heating resulting from geothermal systems to accelerate biodegradation of certain petroleum-based pollutants at brown-field sites, while providing building(s) with sustainable heating and cooling. This idea coincides with the rising momentum towards sustainable and green remediation in Europe and the United States. To ensure that Geothermal Remediation is achievable, the effect of heat on bioremediation needs to be examined. This review provides an insight into what we know about heat effects on bioremediation activities and subsurface transport.',\n",
              " \"Adults with Down syndrome are genetically predisposed to develop Alzheimer's disease and accumulate beta-amyloid plaques (Aß) early in life. While Aß has been heavily studied in Down syndrome, its relationship with neurofibrillary tau is less understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate neurofibrillary tau deposition in individuals with Down syndrome with varying levels of Aß burden.,These results show that even the earliest detectable Aß accumulation in Down syndrome is accompanied by elevated tau in the early Braak stage regions. This early detection of tau can help characterize the tau accumulation phase during preclinical Alzheimer's disease progression in Down syndrome and suggests that there may be a relatively narrow window after Aß accumulation begins to prevent the downstream cascade of events that leads to Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",
              " 'Electrophysiological signals in the human motor system may change in different ways after deafferentation, with some studies emphasizing reorganization while others propose retained physiology. Understanding whether motor electrophysiology is retained over longer periods of time can be invaluable for patients with paralysis (e.g. ALS or brainstem stroke) when signals from sensorimotor areas may be used for communication or control over neural prosthetic devices. In addition, a maintained electrophysiology can potentially benefit the treatment of phantom limb pains through prolonged use of these signals in a brain-machine interface (BCI). Here, we were presented with the unique opportunity to investigate the physiology of the sensorimotor cortex in a patient with an amputated arm using electrocorticographic (ECoG) measurements. While implanted with an ECoG grid for clinical evaluation of electrical stimulation for phantom limb pain, the patient performed attempted finger movements with the contralateral (lost) hand and executed finger movements with the ipsilateral (healthy) hand. The electrophysiology of the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the amputated hand remained very similar to that of hand movement in healthy people, with a spatially focused increase of high-frequency band (65-175\\xa0Hz; HFB) power over the hand region and a distributed decrease in low-frequency band (15-28\\xa0Hz; LFB) power. The representation of the three different fingers (thumb, index and little) remained intact and HFB patterns could be decoded using support vector learning at single-trial classification accuracies of >90%, based on the first 1-3\\xa0s of the HFB response. These results indicate that hand representations are largely retained in the motor cortex. The intact physiological response of the amputated hand, the high distinguishability of the fingers and fast temporal peak are encouraging for neural prosthetic devices that target the sensorimotor cortex.',\n",

It is unclear if these conditions are causally related, if they share a common underlying etiology, or if there are bidirectional effects. Studies investigating these associations have mostly involved children who are already using words to communicate, but it is important to know whether delays in preverbal communication and language development have any effects on these associations. The aim of the present study was to examine associations between preverbal communication and early verbal skills in infancy and subsequent social-emotional competencies and ensuing social-emotional and behavioral problems in early toddlerhood. The role of background factors known to influence early language development was also examined.,The sample consisted of 395 children (51.6% boys) from the Finnish Steps Study cohort. Language was assessed at age 13 months (+ 1 month) with the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory for Infants (CDI-I), and the social-emotional domain was assessed at age < 17 months with the Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA).,Infants with lower preverbal gestural communication and receptive language skills had a higher risk of delays in social-emotional competencies in toddlerhood than children with better communication skills, but not of elevated social-emotional and behavioral problems.,The results indicate that lower early communication skills can predict delays in the development of social-emotional competencies, which has been found to be a risk factor for later development of social-emotional and behavioral problems. It is important to monitor early communication skills to provide guidance to parents in supporting early pragmatic communication and language development in infancy, if needed.',\n",

              " 'Retroelements are genetic mobile elements, expressed during male and female gamete differentiation. Retrotransposons are normally regulated by the methylation machinery, chromatin modifications, non-coding RNAs, and transcription factors, while retrotransposition control is of vital importance in cellular proliferation and differentiation process. Retrotransposition requires a transcription step, by a cellular RNA polymerase, followed by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate to cDNA and its integration into a new genomic locus. Long interspersed elements (LINEs), human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), short interspersed elements (SINEs) and SINE-VNTR-Alu elements (SVAs) constitute about half of the human genome, play a crucial role in genome organization, structure and function and interfere with several biological procedures. In this mini review, we discuss recent data regarding retroelement expression (LINE-1, HERVK-10, SVA and VL30) and retrotransposition events in mammalian oocytes and spermatozoa, as well as the importance of their impact on human and mouse preimplantation embryo development.',\n",
              " 'Osteoid osteoma, the third most common benign bone tumor, usually occurs in the cortex of long bones. It consists of a radiolucent nidus surrounded by reactive osteosclerosis. Generally, osteoid osteoma affects young males. Nocturnal pain that eases with salicylates or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) is the typical clinical presentation. Sometimes, it remains undiagnosed for a long time. Plain radiography and computed tomography are usually sufficient for the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma. Initial treatment includes salicylates and NSAID because the tumor often regresses spontaneously over 2-6 years. Surgical treatment is indicated in case of unresponsive pain to medical therapy, no tolerance of prolonged NSAID therapy due to side effects, and no willingness to activity limitations. Nowadays, minimally invasive techniques have replaced open surgery and are considered the gold standard of surgical treatment. Although cryoablation seems superior in terms of the nerve damage and immunotherapy effect, radiofrequency ablation is the preferred technique.',\n",

Clinical characteristics, diagnostic and treatment options of SFTs originating in the seminal vesicle are presented in this review article.,A systematic review including the following databases: Scopus, Embase and Medline from 1960 until the end of March 2021 was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines.,We found seven patients affected with SFTs of seminal vesicle, in which we added our own case, making a total of 8 patients. Mean age at presentation was 55±7 years. Mean size of the SFTs was 9±2 cm and the right seminal vesicle was preferentially involved. The majority of patients were symptomatic and presenting symptoms were hematuria, dysuria, hematospermia, urinary increased frequency and urgency. Abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) scan, and magnetic resonance (MRI) were the diagnostic tools. Trans-rectal ultrasound-guided core biopsy was also used.

The aim of the present study was to develop a labelling technique that would allow improved visualization of GEJ tumor margins for surgeons to reduce recurrence rates in a patient-like model.,A patient GEJ tumor was obtained from an endoscopic biopsy and implanted subcutaneously in a nude mouse. A patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model was established by implanting tumor fragments grown from a subcutaneous model to the cardia of the stomach of nude mice. CC1/3/5-SAB, an antibody to carcinoembryonic-antigen-related cell-adhesion molecules, was conjugated with infrared dye IRDye800 to create SAB-IR800. Forty-eight hours after i.v. injection of SAB-IR800, GEJ-PDOX mice were imaged.,Fluorescence imaging with SAB-IR800 brightly visualized the GEJ adenocarcinoma demonstrating specific targeting. In the PDOX model, injection of SAB-IR800 (50 µg) resulted in a tumor to background ratio of 1.78 at 48 hours and 1.86 at 72 hours.,PDOX models of GEJ tumors can be established from patients by endoscopic biopsy without undergoing surgical resection.

Possible influencing factors including donor teeth, concentrations of the KnockOut Serum Replacement (KSR), seeding density (regarding surface and volume), passage and freezing were tested.,DPCs from all 6 donor teeth formed spheroids in serum-free medium. Number, size, and total area of spheroids varied among different donor teeth. Optimal concentration of the KSR and seeding densities also varied from tooth to tooth. Generally, high KSR and high cell density lead to better spheroid formation. However, very high KSR and cell density can also lead to cell death and the fusion of spheroids to irregular aggregates.',\n",

Especially interleukine (IL-)6 is involved in the development of aggressive PCa. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) have been reported to interact with cancer cells and subsequently lead to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, the role of anti-nflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4 is still largely unexplored in prostate cancer. In the present study, we investigated the effects of IL-4 on PBMC co-cultured with PCa cells.,PBMC were co-culured with the PCa cell lines LNCaP and LNCaP-IL6+. To avoid cell-cell contact, cancer and immune cells were separated using cell culture inserts with a 0.4 µm pore size membrane. Cell growth was assessed using the [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] (MTT) assay. Cytokine levels were measured using a BD™Cytometric Bead Array.,Cell viability of LNCaP cells decreased massively when cells were co-cultured with PBMC. Pre-incubation with IL-4 could partly rescue the observed effect of cell viability of LNCaP cells co-cultured with PBMC. In contrast, cell viability of the LNCaP-IL6+ cell line was not affected when co-cultured with PBMC.,IL-4 counteracts the cytotoxic effects of PBMC on hormone-sensitive LNCaP cells and is involved in the immune escape and development of aggressive phenotypes of PCa.',\n",

The study aimed to develop improved mouse stool collection methods and diarrhea-scoring criteria.,We developed improved stool collection methods (paper towel methods) and compared them with previously used ones (stool collection using regular cages containing bedding chips or filter paper and metabolic cages).,Compared to previously used methods, paper towel methods collected stools without bedding chips-induced contamination, mouse body/foot-induced damage, or sampling errors. When using paper towel methods, wet stools create water marks (diarrhea marks) on paper towels with strong water absorption capacity, by which diarrheal severity can be analyzed semi-quantitatively. To improve the objectivity in determining diarrhea scores, practical diarrhea-scoring criteria were also proposed.,These results would be helpful to researchers facing difficulties in evaluating the mouse diarrhea score.',\n",

The development of new treatment strategies is needed, and moreover, optimal rodent models are necessary for testing the efficacy of new treatment modalities of osteosarcoma. Humanized mice carry human hematopoietic and immune systems, and are considered an ideal tool to study human diseases including cancer immunology. Herein, we performed a preliminary study toward developing an in vivo bioluminescent osteosarcoma model using humanized immunodeficient (NSG) mice.,KHOS/NP-luc cells injected in humanized NSG mice formed macroscopic tumors. The percentage of human CD45+ cells in these models was similar, but the percentage of human CD45+CD3+ and their subset was higher in the late-injection group compared to that of the early-injection group. The rate of KHOS/NP tumor growth was higher in the early-injection group than in the late-injection group. In the present study, human hematopoietic cell engraftment was not influenced by KHOS/NP cell injection, but KHOS/NP osteosarcoma showed more aggressive behavior in the early-injection group than that in the late-injection group, forming larger tumor volumes and earlier metastases.,The results indicated that tumor growth and progression in humanized NSG mice may have been influenced by higher levels of human cell engraftment, especially T cells. Although there exist some limitations to our study, our preliminary results can provide the basis for the development of a humanized osteosarcoma mouse model.',\n",

Glycyrrhizin has been used to treat hepatic dysfunction caused by high-dose methotrexate. However, few studies have investigated the interaction between glycyrrhizin and high-dose methotrexate.,Male Wistar rats were treated with high-dose methotrexate (500 or 1,000 mg/kg) alone, or with co-administration of 100 mg/kg glycyrrhizin. Plasma concentrations of methotrexate, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were measured.,At both methotrexate doses, the blood concentration of methotrexate was significantly increased and total clearance was significantly reduced using co-administration of glycyrrhizin compared with methotrexate alone, which led to increased levels of hepatic enzymes. These results suggest that glycyrrhizin significantly increases the plasma level and delays the clearance of methotrexate, resulting in hepatic toxicity.,The concomitant use of methotrexate and glycyrrhizin should be considered with caution.',\n",

To explore and develop a new improved spinal correction system (ISCS) for clinical application, we studied the stability and biomechanical characteristics of the ISCS through finite element analysis and comparison of the ISCS with the pedicle screw and rod system (PSRS).,Using L1-L3 CT image data of a normal adult male lumbar spine for establishment of L1-L3 finite element model, we established posterior internal fixation models for a comparative finite element analysis of PSRS and ISCS. An axial load of 500 N and a moment of 10 N•m were applied to L1 to simulate flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. Stress distribution characteristics, load sharing, strain bending stiffness and strain angle change of the models were measured.,In flection and extension directions, the maximum stress of the L2 vertebral body and the L1/2 and L2/3 discs in PSRS was less than that of ISCS. In lateral bending and axial rotation directions, the maximum stress between PSRS and ISCS was similar. However, the stress shielding rate of L2, L1/2, and L2/3 intervertebral discs in ISCS was significantly lower than that of PSRS. We also found that both models had similar angular displacement and maximum displacement in lateral bending direction, but PSRS had a lower angular displacement and maximum displacement in flection and extension directions. Finally, we showed that PSRS had similar angular displacement and a lower maximum displacement compared with ISCS in axial rotation, whereas ISCS had lower bending stiffness than PSRS in different directions.,ISCS can effectively fix spinal deformities compared to PSRS. ISCS provides a new option for orthopedic surgery treatment of scoliosis and, therefore, warrants further clinical studies in patients with other spinal deformities.',\n",

We used serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, serum leukocyte counts and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (NLRs) as parameters of systemic inflammatory reactions. Evaluations of these parameters were performed before and 24 h after pleurodesis.,Pleurodesis was successful in 81 (84.4%) patients. The non-graded talc induced the highest changes in serum CRP levels, total white blood cell and neutrophil counts compared to other agents, while mitoxantrone induced the lowest. Graded talc and bleomycin induced the same levels of changes in serum CRP levels and serum leukocyte counts. The change in serum NLR was the same for all agent groups. Logistic regression confirmed that a change in serum CRP levels [odds ratio (OR)=0.92, p=0.002] and previous chemotherapy (OR=3.31, p=0.012) were independent predictors of pleurodesis efficacy.,Pleurodesis agents induced a systemic inflammatory response at different levels.

Image acquisition intervals during treatment were set at 35-60 sec. Automatic image matchings were performed between the reference digital reconstructed radiography (DRR) and live images, and the spinal position displacements were logged in six translational and rotational directions. If the displacements exceeded 2 mm or 1 degree, the treatment beam delivery was interrupted and the patient position was corrected by moving couch, and the couch adjustments were also logged. Based on the information, the time-dependent accumulated translational and rotational displacements without any couch adjustments were calculated.,Spinal position displacements in all translational and rotational directions were correlated with elapsed treatment time. Especially, Right-Left displacements of >1 mm and >2 mm were observed at 4-6 and 8-10 min after treatment initiation, respectively. Rotational displacements in the Yaw direction >1° were observed at 10-15 min after treatment initiation.,The translational and rotational displacements systematically increased with elapsed treatment time. It is suggested that the spine position should be checked at least every 4-6 min or the treatment time should be limited within 4-6 minutes to ensure the irradiation accuracy within the millimeter or submillimeter range.',\n",

Celastrol is a plant-derived triterpene which showed neuroprotective potential in several types of brain insults. This study aimed to investigate the effects of celastrol on early brain injury (EBI) after SAH.,A total of sixty-one male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. Rat SAH endovascular perforation model was established to mimic the pathological changes of EBI after SAH. Multiple methods such as 3.0T MRI scanning, immunohistochemistry, western blotting and propidium iodide (PI) labeling were used to explore the therapeutic effects of celastrol on SAH.,Celastrol treatment attenuated SAH-caused brain swelling, reduced T2 lesion volume and ventricular volume in MRI scanning, and improved overall neurological score. Albumin leakage and the degradation of tight junction proteins were also ameliorated after celastrol administration. Celastrol protected blood-brain bairrer integrity through inhibiting MMP-9 expression and anti-neuroinflammatory effects. Additionally, necroptosis-related proteins RIP3 and MLKL were down-regulated and PI-positive cells in the basal cortex were less in the celastrol-treated SAH group than that in untreated SAH group.,Celastrol exhibits neuroprotective effects on EBI after SAH and deserves to be further investigated as an add-on pharmaceutical therapy.',\n",

Moreover, potential target mRNAs were also predicted. The relative level of gene and protein expression in GA cell lines and gastric mucosa cells was detected by q-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Moreover, the influence of APBB2 on proliferation, metastasis, and cell cycle changes in SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cells was evaluated. The binding relationship between the target miRNA and mRNA was confirmed with a dual-luciferase reporter assay.,High APBB2 expression was detected in GA patients, indicating that it may be represent a predictive biomarker for poor prognosis. Related experiments confirmed that APBB2 silencing inhibited GA cellular functions, including proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration, and invasion. In addition, to explore the molecular mechanism, our results indicated that the binding sites were located at hsa-mir-30a and the 3'-UTR of APBB2, suggesting that hsa-mir-30a can regulate the expression of APBB2. The biological functions of hsa-mir-30a were also evaluated. Hsa-mir-30a overexpression attenuated the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells. In rescue experiments, hsa-mir-30a was confirmed to reverse the cell cycle promoting function associated with APBB2 overexpression.,Our findings show that hsa-mir-30a can attenuate the development of GA by down-regulating APBB2 expression.\",\n",

In this study, we investigated alteration of the gut microbiota after multiple neonatal exposures to the anesthetic sevoflurane and the potential role of microbiota alteration on cognitive impairment using a young mice model. Multiple neonatal sevoflurane exposures resulted in obvious cognitive impairment symptoms and altered gut microbiota composition. Fecal transplantation experiments confirmed that alteration of the microbiota was responsible for the cognitive disorders in young mice. Microbiota profiling analysis identified microbial taxa that showed consistent differential abundance before and after fecal microbiota transplantation. Several of the differentially abundant taxa are associated with memory and/or health of the host, such as species of Streptococcus, Lachnospiraceae, and Pseudoflavonifractor. The results reveal that abnormal composition of the gut microbiota is a risk factor for cognitive impairment in young mice after multiple neonatal exposures to sevoflurane and provide insight into a potential therapeutic strategy for sevoflurane-related neurotoxicity.',\n",

The median brain stem-vermis (BV) angle was 27° (IQR 24-29°). In 37.9% of the cases, a regression of the finding with restoration of normal anatomy was noted at a follow-up scan or at postnatal checks. A BV angle of 25° or less predicted regression with a probability in excess of 90%. MRI was performed in utero or at birth in 101 patients and always confirmed sonographic diagnosis. Fetal CGH array and/or karyotype was available in 97 cases and was always normal, but in 1 case. A postnatal follow-up was available in 102 infants (mean 7 months, range 0-10 years of age) and documented a normal neurologic development in all the cases.,Isolated URCV is most likely a normal variant of fetal anatomy without clinical consequences, at least at an early follow-up. A BV angle of 25° or less predicts intrauterine regression of the finding, but the outcome is good in all the cases. When a confident sonographic diagnosis is made, MRI is not mandatory.

This work aimed to estimate the proportion of dementia due to Down syndrome, Parkinson's disease, clinical stroke, and traumatic brain injury (TBI), globally and by world region, in order to better understand the contribution of clinical diseases to dementia prevalence.,Through literature review, we obtained data on the relative risk of dementia with each condition and estimated relative risks by age using a Bayesian meta-regression tool. We then calculated population attributable fractions (PAFs), or the proportion of dementia attributable to each condition, using the estimates of relative risk and prevalence estimates for each condition from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. Finally, we multiplied these estimates by dementia prevalence to calculate the number of dementia cases attributable to each condition.,For each clinical condition, the relative risk of dementia decreased with age. Relative risks were highest for Down syndrome, followed by Parkinson's disease, stroke, and TBI. However, due to the high prevalence of stroke, the PAF for dementia due to stroke was highest. Together, Down syndrome, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and TBI explained 10.0% (95% UI: 6.0-16.5) of the global prevalence of dementia.,Ten percent of dementia prevalence globally could be explained by Down syndrome, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and TBI. The quantification of the proportion of dementia attributable to these 4 conditions constitutes a small contribution to our overall understanding of what causes dementia. However, epidemiological research into modifiable risk factors as well as basic science research focused on elucidating intervention approaches to prevent or delay the neuropathological changes that commonly characterize dementia will be critically important in future efforts to prevent and treat disease.\",\n",

              " 'The End-TB strategy aims to see a world free of tuberculosis (TB) by the coming decade through detecting and treating all cases irrespective of socioeconomic inequalities. However, case detections and treatment outcomes have not been as they should be in Somali pastoral settings of Ethiopia. Hence, this study aimed to explore the challenges that hinder the delivery and utilization of TB services in pastoral areas.,A qualitative study was conducted between December 2017 and October 2018 among pastoralist patients with delay of =2 months in seeking healthcare, healthcare providers and programme managers. Data were collected from different sources using 41 in-depth interviews, observations of facilities and a review meeting of providers from 50 health facilities. The data were transcribed, coded and analyzed to identify pre-defined and emerging sub-themes. ATLAS.ti version 7.0 was used for coding data, categorizing codes, and visualizing networks.,Poor knowledge of TB and its services, limited accessibility (unreachability, unavailability and unacceptability), pastoralism, and initial healthcare-seeking at informal drug vendors that provide improper medications were the key barriers hindering the uptake of TB medical services. Inadequate infrastructure, shortage of trained and enthused providers, interruptions of drugs and laboratory supplies, scarce equipment, programme management gaps, lack of tailored approach, low private engagement, and cross-border movement were the major challenges affecting the provision of TB services for pastoral communities. The root factors were limited potential healthcare coverage, lack of zonal and district TB units, mobility and drought, strategy and funding gaps, and poor development infrastructure.,In pastoral settings of Ethiopia, the major challenges of TB services are limited access, illicit medication practices, inadequate resources, structural deficits, and lack of tailored approaches. Hence, for the pastoral TB control to be successful, mobile screening and treatment modalities and engaging rural drug vendors will be instrumental in enhancing case findings and treatment compliance; whereas, service expansion and management decentralization will be essential to create responsive structures for overcoming challenges.',\n",
              " \"The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown evoked great worries among professionals in the field of domestic violence and abuse (DVA) as they expected a rise of the phenomenon. While many countries reported increased DVA, the Netherlands did not. To understand this discrepancy and the overall impact of the lockdown on DVA support services, we interviewed DVA professionals about their experiences with DVA during the rise of COVID-19, the impact of the lockdown on clients and working conditions, and views on eHealth and online tools.,Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 16 DVA professionals with various specializations. This data was analyzed using open thematic coding and content analysis.,Most professionals did not see an increase in DVA reports but they did notice more severe violence. They experienced less opportunities to detect DVA and worried about their clients' wellbeing and the quality of (online) care. Furthermore, their working conditions rapidly changed, with working from home and online, and they expressed frustration, insecurity and loneliness. Professionals feel eHealth and online tools are not always suitable but they do see them as an opportunity to increase reach and maintain services when physical contact is not possible.,This study suggests DVA was probably under-detected during the lockdown rather than not having increased. The Dutch system heavily relies on professionals to detect and report DVA, suggesting a need for critical evaluation of the accessibility of professional help. Professionals experienced significant challenges and should themselves be supported psychologically and in their changed work practices to maintain their ability to aid survivors.\",\n",
              " 'There is an increasing global interest in selection processes for candidates to surgical training. The aim of the present study is to compare selection processes to specialist surgeon training in the European Union (EU). A secondary goal is to provide guidance for evidence-based methods by a proposed minimum standard that would align countries within the EU.,Publications and grey literature describing selection strategies were sought. Correspondence with Union Européenne des Médecins Specialists (UEMS) Section of Surgery delegates was undertaken to solicit current information on national selection processes. Content analysis of 13 semi-structured interviews with experienced Swedish surgeons on the selection process. Two field trips to Ireland, a country with a centralized selection process were conducted. Based on collated information typical cases of selection in a centralized and decentralized setting, Ireland and Sweden, are described and compared.,A multitude of methods for selection to surgical training programs were documented in the 27 investigated countries, ranging from locally run processes with unstructured interviews to national systems for selection of trainees with elaborate structured interviews, and non-technical and technical skills assessments. Associated with the difference between centralized and decentralized selection systems is whether surgical training is primarily governed by an employment or educational logic. Ireland had the most centralized and elaborate system, conducting a double selection process using evidence-based methods along an educational logic. On the opposite end of the scale Sweden has a decentralized, local selection process with a paucity of evidence-based methods, no national guidelines and operates along an employment logic, and Spain that rely solely on examination tests to rank candidates.,The studied European countries all have different processes for selection of surgical trainees and the use of evidence-based methods for selection is variable despite similar educational systems. Selection in decentralized systems is currently often conducted non-transparent and subjectively. A suggested improvement towards an evidence-based framework for selection applicable in centralized and decentralized systems as well as educational and employer logics is suggested.',\n",
              " 'Syphilis infections have been on the rise, affecting men living with HIV in urban centres disproportionately. Since individuals in HIV care undergo routine blood testing, HIV clinics provide practical opportunities to conduct regular and frequent syphilis testing. Following the implementation of a routine syphilis testing intervention in HIV outpatient clinics, we conducted a qualitative process evaluation of patient experiences to measure patient acceptability, barriers to implementation, and facilitators of successful uptake.,Upon completion of the trial, which took place at four HIV outpatient clinics in Toronto and Ottawa, Canada, we recruited male patients attending these clinics from November 2017 to April 2018. Interviews were conducted on-site and were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. All participants provided written informed consent. Interview data were analyzed using grounded theory, assessing qualitative modulators of effective uptake of routinised syphilis testing.,A total of 21 male patients were interviewed. Overall, interviewees found the clinical intervention acceptable, endorsing the practice of routinising syphilis testing alongside regular viral load bloodwork. Some men preferred, based on their self-assessment of syphilis risk, to opt out of testing; we considered this as a potential barrier to uptake of population-wide routinised syphilis testing. Interviewees also identified multiple facilitators of successful uptake, including the de-stigmatising of STI testing as a consequence of the universal nature of routinised testing. Participants recommended a routinised syphilis screening intervention to give patients peace of mind surrounding their sexual health. Participants identified HIV care clinics as comfortable and efficient locations to offer testing.,Overall, most men were in support of implementing routinised syphilis testing as part of standard HIV care. From the patient perspective, HIV care clinics are convenient places to be tested for syphilis, and the routine approach was viewed to have a de-stigmatisng effect on syphilis testing.,ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02019043; registered December 23, 2013.',\n",

Studies that were multifactorial or contained exercise interventions for both hip and knee arthroplasty were also included.,The definition, type of measurement used and outcome for exercise adherence were collected and analyzed descreptively. Quality of reporting of exercise interventions were assessed using the Consensus for Exercise Reporting Tool (CERT) and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.,There were a total of 112 RCTs included in this review. The majority of RCTs (63%, n = 71) did not report exercise adherence. Only 23% (n = 15) of studies provided a definition of adherence. RCTs were of poor quality, with 85% (n = 95) of studies having high or unclear risk of bias. Reporting of exercise interventions was poor, with only 4 items (of 19) (21%) of the CERT adequately reported (88-99%), with other items not fulfilled on at least 60% of the RCTs. There were no RCTs that had fulfilled all the criteria for the CERT.,The RCTs included in this study poorly reported exercise adherence, as well as description of the post-operative TKA rehabilitation intervention.

Early detection of irAEs could result in improved toxicity profile and quality of life. Symptom data collected by electronic (e) patient-reported outcomes (PRO) could be used as an input for machine learning (ML) based prediction models for the early detection of irAEs.,The utilized dataset consisted of two data sources. The first dataset consisted of 820 completed symptom questionnaires from 34 ICI treated advanced cancer patients, including 18 monitored symptoms collected using the Kaiku Health digital platform. The second dataset included prospectively collected irAE data, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) class, and the\\xa0severity of 26 irAEs. The ML models were built using extreme gradient boosting algorithms. The first model was trained to detect the presence and the second the onset of irAEs.,The model trained to predict the presence of irAEs had an excellent performance based on four metrics: accuracy score 0.97, Area Under the Curve (AUC) value 0.99, F1-score 0.94 and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) 0.92. The prediction of the irAE onset was more difficult with accuracy score 0.96, AUC value 0.93, F1-score 0.66 and MCC 0.64 but the model performance was still at a good level.,The\\xa0current study suggests that ML based prediction models, using ePRO data as an input, can predict the presence and onset of irAEs with a\\xa0high accuracy, indicating that ePRO follow-up with ML algorithms could facilitate the detection of irAEs in ICI-treated cancer patients.

              " 'The pursuit of a cure for HIV is a high priority for researchers, funding agencies, governments and people living with HIV (PLWH). To date, over 250 biomedical studies worldwide are or have been related to discovering a safe, effective, and scalable HIV cure, most of which are early translational research and experimental medicine. As HIV cure research increases, it is critical to identify and address the ethical challenges posed by this research.,We conducted a scoping review of the growing HIV cure research ethics literature, focusing on articles published in English peer-reviewed journals from 2013 to 2021. We extracted and summarized key developments in the ethics of HIV cure research. Twelve community advocates actively engaged in HIV cure research provided input on this summary and suggested areas warranting further ethical inquiry and foresight via email exchange and video conferencing.,Despite substantial scholarship related to the ethics of HIV cure research, additional attention should focus on emerging issues in six categories of ethical issues: (1) social value (ongoing and emerging biomedical research and scalability considerations); (2) scientific validity (study design issues, such as the use of analytical treatment interruptions and placebos); (3) fair selection of participants (equity and justice considerations); (4) favorable benefit/risk balance (early phase research, benefit-risk balance, risk perception, psychological risks, and pediatric research); (5) informed consent (attention to language, decision-making, informed consent processes and scientific uncertainty); and (6) respect for enrolled participants and community (perspectives of people living with HIV and affected communities and representation).,HIV cure research ethics has an unfinished agenda. Scientific research and bioethics should work in tandem to advance ethical HIV cure research. Because the science of HIV cure research will continue to rapidly advance, ethical considerations of the major themes we identified will need to be revisited and refined over time.',\n",
              " 'The extension of palliative care services to meet the needs of patients with chronic non-malignant life-limiting conditions faces misconceptions amongst healthcare professionals. A study of prevailing perceptions of healthcare professionals on this wider palliative care service was thus conducted to identify current obstacles, guide the education of local healthcare professionals and improve service accessibility.,A cross-sectional study was carried out at the Singapore General Hospital. An anonymised and close-ended online questionnaire was disseminated to 120 physicians and 500 nurses in the Department of Internal Medicine. The online survey tool focused on participant demographics; perceptions of palliative care and its perceived benefits; roles and indications; and attitudes and behaviours towards palliative care referrals.,Forty four physicians and 156 nurses suggested that care of terminally ill patients with chronic non-malignant life-limiting conditions are compromised by concerns over the role of palliative care in non-cancer care and lapses in their prognostication and communication skills. Respondents also raised concerns about their ability to confront sociocultural issues and introduce palliative care services to patients and their families.,Gaps in understanding and the ability of nurses and physicians to communicate end of life issues, introduce palliative care services to patients and their families and confront sociocultural issues suggest the need for a longitudinal training program. With similar concerns likely prevalent in other clinical settings within this island nation, a concerted national education program targeting obstacles surrounding effective palliative care should be considered.',\n",
              " 'Radiation therapy is an important part of multimodal breast cancer treatment. The aim was to examine the impact of sociodemographic factors on radiation therapy use in breast cancer (BC) patients in Estonia, linking cancer registry data to administrative databases.,Estonian Cancer Registry provided data on women diagnosed with BC in Estonia in 2007-2018, including TNM stage at diagnosis. Use of radiation therapy within 12 months of diagnosis was determined from Estonian Health Insurance Funds claims, and sociodemographic characteristics from population registry. Receipt of radiation therapy was evaluated over time and by clinical and sociodemographic factors. Poisson regression with robust variance was used to calculate univariate and multivariate prevalence rate ratios (PRR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for receipt of radiation therapy among stage I-III BC patients age < 70 years who underwent primary surgery.,Overall, of 8637 women included in the study, 4310 (50 %) received radiation therapy within 12 months of diagnosis. This proportion increased from 39 to 58 % from 2007 to 2009 to 2016-2018 (p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that compared to women with stage I BC, those with more advanced stage were less likely to receive radiation therapy. Receipt of radiation therapy increased significantly over time and was nearly 40 % higher in 2016-2018 than in 2007-2009. Use of radiation therapy was significantly lower for women with the lowest level of education compared to those with a university degree (PRR 0.88, 95 % CI 0.80-0.97), and for divorced/widowed women (PRR 0.95, 95 % CI 0.91-0.99) and single women (PRR 0.92, 95 % CI 0.86-0.99), compared to married women. Age at diagnosis, nationality and place of residence were not associated with receipt of radiation therapy.,The study showed considerable increase in the use of radiation therapy in Estonia over the study period, which is in line with increases in available equipment. The lack of geographic variations suggests equal access to therapy for patients living in remote regions. However, educational level and marital status were significantly associated with receipt of radiation therapy, highlighting the importance of psychosocial support in ensuring equal access to care.',\n",

Little is known about the extent of ethical considerations and their influence on prehospital resuscitation. We aimed to determine the transparency in medical records regarding decision-making in prehospital resuscitation with a specific focus on ethically relevant information and consideration in resuscitation providers' documentation.,This was a Danish nationwide retrospective observational study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests from 2016 through 2018. After an initial screening using broadly defined inclusion criteria, two experienced philosophers performed a qualitative content analysis of the included medical records according to a preliminary codebook. We identified ethically relevant content in free-text fields and categorised the information according to Beauchamp and Childress' four basic bioethical principles: autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice.,Of 16,495 medical records, we identified 759 (4.6%) with potentially relevant information; 710 records (4.3%) contained ethically relevant information, whereas 49 did not. In general, the documentation was vague and unclear. We identified four kinds of ethically relevant information: patients' wishes and perspectives on life; relatives' wishes and perspectives on patients' life; healthcare professionals' opinions and perspectives on resuscitation; and do-not-resuscitate orders. We identified some best practice examples that included all perspectives of decision-making.,There is sparse and unclear evidence on ethically relevant information in the medical records documenting resuscitation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. However, the best practice examples show that providing sufficient documentation of decision-making is, in fact, feasible. To ensure transparency surrounding prehospital decisions in cardiac arrests, we believe that it is necessary to ensure more systematic documentation of decision-making in prehospital resuscitation.\",\n",
              " 'Anti-malarial drug resistance may be limited by decreased fitness in resistant parasites. Important contributors to resistance are mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum putative drug transporter PfMDR1.,Impacts on in vitro fitness of two common PfMDR1 polymorphisms, N86Y, which is associated with sensitivity to multiple drugs, and Y184F, which has no clear impact on drug sensitivity, were evaluated to study associations between resistance mediators and parasite fitness, measured as relative growth in competitive culture experiments. NF10 P. falciparum lines engineered to represent all PfMDR1 N86Y and Y184F haplotypes were co-cultured for 40 days, and the genetic make-up of the cultures was characterized every 4 days by pyrosequencing. The impacts of culture with anti-malarials on the growth of different haplotypes were also assessed. Lastly, the engineering of P. falciparum containing another common polymorphism, PfMDR1 D1246Y, was attempted.,Co-culture results were as follows. With wild type (WT) Y184 fixed (N86/Y184 vs. 86Y/Y184), parasites WT and mutant at 86 were at equilibrium. With mutant 184\\xa0F fixed (N86/184F vs. 86Y/184F), mutants at 86 overgrew WT. With WT N86 fixed (N86/Y184 vs. N86/184F), WT at 184 overgrew mutants. With mutant 86Y fixed (86Y/Y184 vs. 86Y/184F), WT and mutant at 86 were at equilibrium. Parasites with the double WT were in equilibrium with the double mutant, but 86Y/Y184 overgrew N86/184F. Overall, WT N86/mutant 184F parasites were less fit than parasites with all other haplotypes. Parasites engineered for another mutation, PfMDR1 1246Y, were unstable in culture, with reversion to WT over time. Thus, the N86 WT is stable when accompanied by the Y184 WT, but incurs a fitness cost when accompanied by mutant 184F. Culturing in the presence of chloroquine favored 86Y mutant parasites and in the presence of lumefantrine favored N86 WT parasites; piperaquine had minimal impact.,These results are consistent with those for Ugandan field isolates, suggest reasons for varied haplotypes, and highlight the interplay between drug pressure and fitness that is guiding the evolution of resistance-mediating haplotypes in P. falciparum.',\n",
              " 'Longitudinal studies demonstrate an average decline in physical activity (PA) from adolescence to young adulthood. However, while some subgroups of adolescents decrease activity, others increase or maintain high or low activity. Activity domains may differ between subgroups (exhibiting different PA patterns), and they offer valuable information for targeted health promotion. Hence, the aim of this study was to identify PA patterns from adolescence to young adulthood; also to explore the associations of (i) changes in PA domains and in sedentary time, (ii) sociodemographic factors, and (iii) self-rated health with diverging PA patterns.,The observational cohort study data encompassed 254 adolescents at age 15 and age 19. K-means cluster analysis for longitudinal data was performed to identify participant clusters (patterns) based on their accelerometry-measured moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Logistic regressions were applied in further analysis.,Five PA patterns were identified: inactivity maintainers (n = 71), activity maintainers (n = 70), decreasers from moderate (to low) PA (n = 61), decreasers from high (to moderate) PA (n = 32), and increasers (n = 20). At age 15, participation in sports clubs (SC, 41-97%) and active commuting (AC, 47-75%) was common in all the patterns. By age 19, clear dropout from these activities was prevalent (SC participation mean 32%, AC 31-63%). Inactivity maintainers reported the lowest amount of weekly school physical education. Dropout from SC - in contrast to non-participation in SC - was associated with higher odds of being a decreaser from high PA, and with lower odds of being an inactivity maintainer. Maintained SC participation was associated with higher odds of belonging to the decreasers from high PA, and to the combined group of activity maintainers and increasers; also with lower odds of being an inactivity maintainer. Maintenance/adoption of AC was associated with decreased odds of being an inactivity maintainer. Self-reported health at age 19 was associated with the patterns of maintained activity and inactivity.,PA patterns diverge over the transition to adulthood. Changes in SC participation and AC show different associations with diverging PA patterns. Hence, tailored PA promotion is recommended.',\n",

In this study, we examined joint associations between prenatal exposure to PFAS, PBDEs, and maternal and newborn telomere length using mixture analyses, to characterize effects of cumulative environmental chemical exposures.,Study participants were enrolled in the Chemicals in Our Bodies (CIOB) study, a demographically diverse cohort of pregnant people and children in San Francisco, CA. Seven PFAS (ng/mL) and four PBDEs (ng/g lipid) were measured in second trimester maternal serum\\xa0samples. Telomere length (T/S ratio) was measured in delivery cord blood of 292 newborns and 110\\xa0second trimester maternal whole blood samples. Quantile g-computation was used to assess the joint associations between groups of PFAS and PBDEs and newborn and maternal telomere length. Groups considered were: (1) all PFAS and PBDEs combined, (2) PFAS, and (3) PBDEs. Maternal and newborn telomere length were modeled as separate outcomes.,T/S ratios in newborn cord and maternal whole blood were moderately correlated (Spearman ? = 0.31). In mixtures analyses, a simultaneous one quartile increase in all PFAS and PBDEs was associated with a small increase in newborn (mean change per quartile increase = 0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.03, 0.08) and maternal telomere length (mean change per quartile increase = 0.03 (95% CI = -0.03, 0.09). When restricted to maternal-fetal paired samples (N = 76), increasing all PFAS and PBDEs combined was associated with a strong, positive increase in newborn telomere length (mean change per quartile increase = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.03, 0.28). These associations were primarily driven by PFAS (mean change per quartile increase = 0.11 [95% CI = 0.01, 0.22]). No associations were observed with maternal telomere length among paired samples.,Our findings suggest that PFAS and PBDEs may be positively associated with newborn telomere length.',\n",

The aim of this study was the translation, cultural adaptation, and validation of the FQOLS-Dementia into Spanish to assess FQOL among family members of individuals with NDs who live in the Spain-Portugal cross-border area.,The Spanish version was translated and adapted following the international guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation tests. A sample of 300 family caregivers was interviewed, applying an adapted version of the Family Quality Survey (FQOLS-Dementia). Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to validate the factor structure, and convergent validity was examined with Pearson's correlation coefficients of the global FQOL with the domains. Internal consistency reliability was determined using Cronbach's alpha.,The domain structure of the FQOLS-ND showed a good fit. In the convergent validity, it was found that the total score and the subscale domain scores were associated with the global FQOL score, except for the Values domain. Internal consistency of nine domain subscales was strong (a = 0.80 to 0.91), and excellent for the total FQOL (a = 0.85) and the global FQOL (a = 0.87).,The FQOLS-ND presented good validity and reliability in caregiver families with individuals with ND, so its application shows its usefulness in detecting areas of improvement and intervention strategies for FQOL in the Spain-Portugal cross-border area.\",\n",

The accurate diagnosis of DSRCT is challenging owing to limited literatures. Our study aimed to investigate the relationship between clinicopathological features and prognosis in patients with DSRCTs.,Data of 8 patients with DSRCT originating from the abdominal cavity were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical manifestations, pathological characteristics, treatment approaches, and prognosis were analyzed. The histopathological (identified using hematoxylin-eosin staining), immunohistochemical, and molecular diagnostic (using fluorescence in situ hybridization) features were also reviewed.,All patients were male aged between 24 and 45 years (median age, 30 years). The main clinical symptoms included abdominal distension, abdominal pain, and constipation. Seven of the 8 patients developed metastases to either distant organs or lymph nodes. Multiple gray nodules with diameters of 1-10 cm and poorly defined boundaries were scattered throughout the omentum and mesentery. Histopathological examination demonstrated well-defined nests composed of small round blue cells separated by markedly desmoplastic stroma. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive expressions of desmin, vimentin and C-terminal of Wilm's tumor suppressor (WT-1). The Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 gene fused with WT1 (EWSR1-WT1) gene fusion was detected in all patients. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) was performed in 6 patients. Follow-up period ranged from 7.5 to 28.5 months with a median of 17.2 months. Three patients died during follow-up.,DSRCT is highly aggressive and presents distinctive morphological features. CRS is the essential therapy for DSRCT. A test for the combined expression of desmin, cytokeratins, and C-terminal of WT-1, as well as the analysis of morphologic features, might be helpful during DSRCT diagnosis, and the EWSR1-WT1 gene fusion is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis. Our work will provide new insights into the diagnosis and treatment of DSRCTs.\",\n",

In this study, we explored the biological roles and underlying mechanism of MSCs-EVs in OA.,Co-culture experiments revealed that MSCs-EVs could promote the expression of collagen type II alpha 1 chain (COL2A1), SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9) and Aggrecan while negatively regulate the expression of chondrocyte hypertrophy markers matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP-13) and RUNX family transcription factor 2 (Runx2) in mouse chondrocytes in the OA model. Besides, the results of cell experiments indicated that MSCs-EVs could notably weaken the suppression of chondrocyte proliferation, migration and the promotion of chondrocyte apoptosis via interleukin1ß (IL-1ß) induction. In addition, MSCs-circHIPK3-EVs (EVs derived from MSCs overexpressing circHIPK3) considerably improved IL-1ß-induced chondrocyte injury. Mechanistically, we elucidated that circHIPK3 could directly bind to miR-124-3p and subsequently elevate the expression of the target gene MYH9.,The findings in our study demonstrated that EVs-circHIPK3 participated in MSCs-EVs-mediated chondrocyte proliferation and migration induction and in chondrocyte apoptosis inhibition via the miR-124-3p/MYH9 axis. This offers a promising novel cell-free therapy for treating OA.',\n",
              " 'The use of online imagery by non-local observers to conduct remote, centralized collection of streetscape audit data in international studies has the potential to enhance efficiency of collection and comparability of such data for research on built environments and health. The objectives of the study were to measure (1) the consistency in responses between local in-field observers and non-local remote online observers and (2) the reliability between in-country online observers and non-local remote online observers using the Microscale Audit of Pedestrian Streetscapes Global tool to characterize pedestrian-related features along streets in five countries.,Consistency and inter-rater reliability were analyzed between local and non-local observers on a pooled database of 200 routes in five study regions (Melbourne, Australia; Ghent, Belgium; Curitiba, Brazil; Hong Kong, China; and Valencia, Spain) for microscale environmental feature subscales and item-level variables using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).,A local in-field versus remote online comparison had an ICC of 0.75 (95 % CI: 0.68-0.80) for the grand total score. An ICC of 0.91 (95 % CI: 0.88-0.93) was found for the local online versus remote online comparison. Positive subscales yielded stronger results in comparison to negative subscales, except for the similarly poor-performing positive aesthetics/social characteristics.,This study demonstrated remote audits of microscale built environments using online imagery had good reliability with local in-field audits and excellent reliability with local online audits. Results generally supported remote online environmental audits as comparable to local online audits. This identification of low-cost and efficient data acquisition methods is important for expanding research on microscale built environments and physical activity globally.',\n",

However, there is a critical information gap regarding previous and ongoing malaria social and behavioural change (SBC) interventions. The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge, attitudes, practices of beneficiaries of SBC interventions.,A descriptive cross-sectional survey was undertaken in 2018 in two rural districts of Zambezia Province, Mozambique. A structured questionnaire was administered to 773 randomly selected households. Respondents were the adult heads of the households. Descriptive statistics were done.,The main results show that 96.4% of respondents recalled hearing about malaria in the previous 6\\xa0months, 90.0% had knowledge of malaria prevention, and 70.0% of preventive measures. Of the 97.7% respondents that had received ITNs through a mass ITN distribution campaign, 81.7% had slept under an ITN the night before the survey. In terms of source of health information, 70.5% mentioned the role of community volunteers in dissemination of malaria prevention messages, 76.1% of respondents considered worship places (churches and mosques) to be the main places where they heard key malaria prevention messages, and 79.1% asserted that community dialogue sessions helped them better understand how to prevent malaria.,Results show that volunteers/activists/teachers played an important role in dissemination of key malaria prevention messages, which brought the following successes: community actors are recognized and people have knowledge of malaria transmission, signs and symptoms, preventive measures, and where to get treatment. There is, however, room for improvement on SBC messaging regarding some malaria symptoms (anaemia and convulsions) and operational research is needed to ascertain the drivers of malaria prevalence and inform the SBC approach.',\n",

As the price of healthy foods is a perceived barrier to improved diets, evidence on the cost and affordability of current (unhealthy) and recommended (healthy, more equitable and sustainable) diets is required to support policy action.,This study applied the Healthy Diets ASAP (Australian Standardised Affordability and Pricing) methods protocol to measure the cost, cost differential and affordability of current and recommended diets for a reference household in Queensland, Australia. Food prices were collected in 18 randomly selected locations stratified by area of socioeconomic disadvantage and remoteness. Diet affordability was calculated for three income categories.,Surprisingly, recommended diets would cost 20% less than the current diet in Queensland as a whole. Households spent around 60% of their food budget on discretionary choices (that is, those not required for health that are high in saturated fat, added sugar, salt and/or alcohol). Queensland families would need to spend around 23% of their income on recommended diets. However, recommended diets would not be affordable in low socioeconomic or very remote areas, costing 30 and 35% of median household income respectively. The government supplements due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic would improve affordability of recommended diets by 29%.,Study findings highlight that while price is one factor affecting consumer food choice, other drivers such as taste, convenience, advertising and availability are important. Nevertheless, the study found that recommended diets would be unaffordable in very remote areas, and that low-income families are likely experiencing food stress, irrespective of where they live in Queensland. Policy actions, such as increasing to 20% the current 10% tax differential between basic healthy, and unhealthy foods in Australia, and supplementing incomes of vulnerable households, especially in remote areas, are recommended to help improve diet equity and sustainability, and health and wellbeing for all.',\n",
              " 'Due to metabolic changes in the second trimester and the increasing number of pregnant women with obesity and advanced maternal age, the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) remains high. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of GDM on fetal cardiac morphology and function, and to determine whether these changes increase with increasing estimated fetal weight (EFW).,Fetuses of women with GDM present with signs of biventricular systolic dysfunction according to deformation analysis using fetal HQ. Additionally, the heart had a rounder shape in the GDM group than in the control group. This study showed that fetal HQ can be used to assess fetal cardiac morphology and function easily and quickly, and the effects of GDM on fetal cardiac morphology and function appeared from the second trimester. Thus, whether earlier and stricter clinical intervention was necessary remained to be further studied. Furthermore, future studies will need to supplement the effects of blood glucose levels on GLS, FAC, GSI, and 24-segment SI. Additionally, the long-term follow-up after birth should also be improved to observe the influence of changes in the indicators on the prognosis.',\n",
              " \"Enrolling sufficient number of people who inject drugs (PWID) into syringe services programs (SSP) is important to curtail outbreaks of drug-related harms. Still, little is known about barriers and facilitators to SSP enrollment in rural areas with no history of such programs. This study's purpose was to develop a grounded theory of the role of the risk environment and individual characteristics of PWID in shaping SSP enrollment in rural Kentucky.,We conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews with 41 clients of 5 SSPs that were established in rural counties in Appalachian Kentucky in 2017-2018. Interviews covered PWID needs, the process of becoming aware of SSPs, and barriers and facilitators to SSP enrollment. Applying constructivist grounded theory methods and guided by the Intersectional Risk Environment Framework (IREF), we applied open, axial and selective coding to develop the grounded theory.,Stigma, a feature of IREF's meso-level social domain, is the main factor hampering SSP enrollment. PWID hesitated to visit SSPs because of internalized stigma and because of anticipated stigma from police, friends, family and healthcare providers. Fear of stigma was often mitigated or amplified by a constellation of meso-level environmental factors related to healthcare (e.g., SSPs) and social (PWID networks) domains and by PWID's individual characteristics. SSPs mitigated stigma as a barrier to enrollment by providing low threshold services in a friendly atmosphere, and by offering their clients program IDs to protect them from paraphernalia charges. SSP clients spread positive information about the program within PWID networks and helped their hesitant peers to enroll by accompanying them to SSPs. Individual characteristics, including child custody, employment or high social status, made certain PWID more susceptible to drug-related stigma and hence more likely to delay SSP enrollment.,Features of the social and healthcare environments operating at the meso-level, as well as PWID's individual characteristics, appear to enhance or mitigate the effect of stigma as a barrier to SSP enrollment. SSPs opening in locations with high stigma against PWID need to ensure low threshold and friendly services, protect their clients from police and mobilize PWID networks to promote enrollment.\",\n",
              " 'Surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and the survival of patients after radical resection is closely related to relapse. We aimed to develop models to predict the risk of relapse using machine learning methods based on multiple clinical parameters.,Data were collected and analysed of 262 PDAC patients who underwent radical resection at 3 institutions between 2013 and 2017, with 183 from one institution as a training set, 79 from the other 2 institution as a validation set. We developed and compared several predictive models to predict 1- and 2-year relapse risk using machine learning approaches.,Machine learning techniques were superior to conventional regression-based analyses in predicting risk of relapse of PDAC after radical resection. Among them, the random forest (RF) outperformed other methods in the training set. The highest accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for predicting 1-year relapse risk with RF were 78.4% and 0.834, respectively, and for 2-year relapse risk were 95.1% and 0.998. However, the support vector machine (SVM) model showed better performance than the others for predicting 1-year relapse risk in the validation set. And the k neighbor algorithm (KNN) model achieved the highest accuracy and AUROC for predicting 2-year relapse risk.,By machine learning, this study has developed and validated comprehensive models integrating clinicopathological characteristics to predict the relapse risk of PDAC after radical resection which will guide the development of personalized surveillance programs after surgery.',\n",

              " 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of mesothelial cells is a key step in the peritoneal fibrosis (PF). Recent evidence indicates that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) might mediate the process of renal fibrosis, which could induce the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a). Here, we investigated the effect of STAT3 activation on HIF-1a expression and the EMT of mesothelial cells, furthermore the role of pharmacological blockade of STAT3 in the process of PF during peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment.,Firstly, we investigated the STAT3 signaling in human peritoneal\\xa0mesothelial cells (HPMCs)\\xa0from drained PD effluent. Secondly, we explored the effect of STAT3 signaling activation on the EMT and the expression of HIF-1a in human mesothelial cells (Met-5A) induced by high glucose. Finally, peritoneal fibrosis was induced by daily intraperitoneal injection with peritoneal dialysis\\xa0fluid (PDF) so as to explore the role of pharmacological blockade of STAT3 in this process.,Compared with the new PD patient, the level of phosphorylated STAT3 was up-regulated in peritoneal mesothelial cells from long-term PD patients. High glucose (60\\xa0mmol/L) induced over-expression of Collagen I, Fibronectin, a-SMA and reduced the\\xa0expression of E-cadherin in Met-5A cells, which could be abrogated by STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 pretreatment as well as by siRNA for STAT3. Furthermore, high glucose-mediated STAT3 activation in mesothelial cells induced the expression of HIF-1a and the profibrotic effect of STAT3 signaling was alleviated by siRNA for HIF-1a. Daily intraperitoneal injection of high-glucose based dialysis fluid (HG-PDF) induced peritoneal fibrosis in the mice, accompanied by the phosphorylation of STAT3. Immunostaining showed that phosphorylated STAT3 was expressed mostly in a-SMA positive cells in the peritoneal membrane induced by HG-PDF. Administration of S3I-201 prevented the progression of peritoneal fibrosis, angiogenesis, macrophage infiltration as well as the expression of HIF-1a in the peritoneal membrane induced by high glucose.,Taken together, these findings identified a novel mechanism linking STAT3/HIF-1a signaling to peritoneal fibrosis during long-term PD treatment. It provided the first evidence that pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 signaling attenuated high glucose-mediated mesothelial cells EMT as well as peritoneal fibrosis.',\n",

However, oxaliplatin resistance greatly reduces its therapeutic effect. SRPK1 involves in pre-mRNA splicing and tumorigenesis. How SRPK1 mediates drug resistance in colon cancer is unknown.,The expression of SRPK1 was analyzed in the TCGA and the CPTAC pan-cancer samples and detected in colon cancer cell lines and tissues by IHC and western blot. The MTT and TUNEL assay were used to verify the anti-apoptosis ability of colon cancer cell. The activation of NF-?B was determined by luciferase assay and qRT-PCR. AKT, IKK, I?B and their phosphorylation level were verified by western blot.,We found that SRPK1 expression was the second highest in TCGA and the CPTAC pan-cancer samples. The mRNA and protein levels of SRPK1 were increased in tissues from patients with colon cancer. SRPK1 was associated with clinical stage and TNM classifications in 148 cases of colon cancer patients. High SRPK1 levels correlated with poor prognosis (p < 0.001). SRPK1 overexpression enhanced the anti-apoptosis ability of colon cancer cells, whereas SRPK1 silencing had the opposite effect under oxaliplatin treatment. Mechanistically, SRPK1 enhances IKK kinase and I?B phosphorylation to promote NF-?B nuclear translocation to confer oxaliplatin resistance.,Our findings suggest that SRPK1 participates in colon cancer progression and enhances the anti-apoptosis capacity to induce drug resistance in colon cancer cells via NF-?B pathway activation, and thus might be a potential pharmaceutically target for colon cancer treatment.',\n",

              " 'Genetic improvement of wool and growth traits is a major goal in the sheep industry, but their underlying genetic architecture remains elusive. To improve our understanding of these mechanisms, we conducted a weighted single-step genome-wide association study (WssGWAS) and then integrated the results with large-scale transcriptome data for five wool traits and one growth trait in Merino sheep: mean fibre diameter (MFD), coefficient of variation of the fibre diameter (CVFD), crimp number (CN), mean staple length (MSL), greasy fleece weight (GFW), and live weight (LW).,Our dataset comprised 7135 individuals with phenotype data, among which 1217 had high-density (HD) genotype data (n = 372,534). The genotypes of 707 of these animals were imputed from the Illumina Ovine single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 54 BeadChip to the HD Array. The heritability of these traits ranged from 0.05 (CVFD) to 0.36 (MFD), and between-trait genetic correlations ranged from - 0.44 (CN vs. LW) to 0.77 (GFW vs. LW). By integrating the GWAS signals with RNA-seq data from 500 samples (representing 87 tissue types from 16 animals), we detected tissues that were relevant to each of the six traits, e.g. liver, muscle and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract were the most relevant tissues for LW, and leukocytes and macrophages were the most relevant cells for CN. For the six traits, 54 quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified covering 81 candidate genes on 21 ovine autosomes. Multiple candidate genes showed strong tissue-specific expression, e.g. BNC1 (associated with MFD) and CHRNB1 (LW) were specifically expressed in skin and muscle, respectively. By conducting phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) in humans, we found that orthologues of several of these candidate genes were significantly (FDR < 0.05) associated with similar traits in humans, e.g. BNC1 was significantly associated with MFD in sheep and with hair colour in humans, and CHRNB1 was significantly associated with LW in sheep and with body mass index in humans.,Our findings provide novel insights into the biological and genetic mechanisms underlying wool and growth traits, and thus will contribute to the genetic improvement and gene mapping of complex traits in sheep.',\n",

Resistance against MRDD is a complex trait that controlled by many quantitative trait loci (QTL) and easily influenced by environmental conditions. So far, many studies have reported numbers of resistant QTL, however, only one QTL have been cloned, so it is especially important to map and clone more genes that confer resistance to MRDD.,In the study, a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) qMrdd2, which confers resistance to MRDD, was identified and fine mapped. qMrdd2, located on chromosome 2, was consistently identified in a 15-Mb interval between the simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers D184 and D1600 by using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between resistant (80007) and susceptible (80044) inbred lines.

Chalkiness is a complex quantitative trait regulated by multiple genes and various environmental factors. Phytohormones play important roles in the regulation of chalkiness formation but the underlying molecular mechanism is still unclear at present.,In this research, Xiangzaoxian24 (X24, pure line of indica rice with high-chalkiness) and its origin parents Xiangzaoxian11 (X11, female parent, pure line of indica rice with high-chalkiness) and Xiangzaoxian7 (X7, male parent, pure line of indica rice with low-chalkiness) were used as materials. The phenotype, physiological and biochemical traits combined with transcriptome analysis were conducted to illustrate the dynamic process and transcriptional regulation of rice chalkiness formation. Impressively, phytohormonal contents and multiple phytohormonal signals were significantly different in chalky caryopsis, suggesting the involvement of phytohormones, particularly ABA and auxin, in the regulation of rice chalkiness formation, through the interaction of multiple transcription factors and their downstream regulators.,These results indicated that chalkiness formation is a dynamic process associated with multiple genes, forming a complex regulatory network in which phytohormones play important roles.

As one of the most economically important poultry, goose owns a unique appearance characteristic called knob, which is located at the base of the upper bill. However, neither the histomorphology nor the genetic mechanism of the knob phenotype has been revealed in geese.,In the present study, integrated radiographic, histological, transcriptomic and genomic analyses revealed the histomorphological characteristics and genetic mechanism of goose knob. The knob skin was developed, and radiographic results demonstrated that the knob bone was obviously protuberant and pneumatized. Histologically, there were major differences in structures in both the knob skin and bone between geese owing knob (namely knob-geese) and those devoid of knob (namely non-knob geese). Through transcriptome analysis, 592 and 952 genes differentially expressed in knob skin and bone, and significantly enriched in PPAR and Calcium pathways in knob skin and bone, respectively, which revealed the molecular mechanisms of histomorphological differences of the knob between knob- and non-knob geese. Furthermore, integrated transcriptomic and genomic analysis contributed to the identification of 17 and 21 candidate genes associated with the knob formation in the skin and bone, respectively. Of them, DIO2 gene could play a pivotal role in determining the knob phenotype in geese. Because a non-synonymous mutation (c.642,923 G > A, P265L) changed DIO2 protein secondary structure in knob geese, and Sanger sequencing further showed that the AA genotype was identified in the population of knob geese, and was prevalent in a crossing population which was artificially selected for 10 generations.,This study was the first to uncover the knob histomorphological characteristics and genetic mechanism in geese, and DIO2 was identified as the crucial gene associated with the knob phenotype. These data not only expand and enrich our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of head appendages in both mammalian and avian species, but also have important theoretical and practical significance for goose breeding.',\n",
              " 'The risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is becoming more prevalent in pregnant women though not much data is available for pregnant women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Foetoplacental vascular endothelial dysfunction is thought to be at the origin of chronic diseases such as diabetes and obesity later on in life. Because HIV and anti-retroviral treatment (ARTs) are associated with endothelial dysfunction, children exposed in utero to these conditions may be at greater risk of developing CVDs. Despite the high prevalence of HIV in pregnant South African women, little is known about the effects of ART on the cardiovascular health of the mother and offspring. Hence, the proposed study intends to investigate how HIV/ARTs may affect the cardiovascular health of the mother and offspring at different time points during the pregnancy and up to 2\\xa0years after birth.,A longitudinal case-control study in HIV positive pregnant women on ART and HIV negative pregnant women will be conducted. All pregnant women will be assessed for cardio-metabolic risk factors and markers (lipids, anthropometric and glycaemic indies, oxidative stress), hemodynamic status (blood pressure parameters) and vascular function (arterial compliance, retinal microvasculature, uterine artery mean pulsatility index). Child health will be monitored in utero and postnatally via routine foetal health screening, placental integrity, anthropometry, blood pressure parameters, markers of oxidative stress and endothelial function in cord blood and cardiovascular epigenetic markers in urine.,There is a paucity of studies in South Africa and sub-Sahara Africa as a whole that utilised a longitudinal study model to assess the effects of ARTs on vascular endothelial changes in pregnant women living with HIV and the cardiometabolic health of their offspring. This study will therefore help to monitor changes in cardiometabolic risk during pregnancy and in children exposed in utero to HIV-infection and ART use. Findings from this study will provide useful information for developing guidelines on the use of ARTs in pregnancy and management of cardiometabolic health of the offspring of HIV positive mothers.',\n",

An increase of the incubation temperature of Japanese quail eggs affected the embryonic and post-hatch survival, growth, surface temperatures and blood characteristics potentially related to thermoregulation capacities. To gain new insights in the molecular basis of TM in quails, we investigated by RNA-seq the hypothalamus transcriptome of 35 days-old male and female quails that were treated by TM or not (C, control) during embryogenesis and that were exposed (HC) or not (RT) to a 36\\xa0°C heat challenge for 7\\xa0h before sampling.,For males, 76, 27, 47 and 0 genes were differentially expressed in the CHC vs. CRT, CRT vs. TMRT, TMHC vs. TMRT and CHC vs. TMHC comparisons, respectively. For females, 17, 0, 342 and 1 genes were differentially expressed within the same respective comparisons. Inter-individual variability of gene expression response was observed particularly when comparing RT and HC female animals. The differential expression of several genes was corroborated by RT-qPCR analysis. Gene Ontology functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes showed a prevalent enrichment of terms related to cellular responses to stimuli and gene expression regulation in both sexes. Gene Ontology terms related to the membrane transport, the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial functions as well as DNA metabolism and repair were also identified in specific comparisons and sexes.,TM had little to no effect on the regulation of gene expression in the hypothalamus of 35 days-old Japanese quails. However, the consequences of TM on gene expression were revealed by the HC, with sex-specific and common functions altered. The effects of the HC on gene expression were most prominent in TM females with a ~ 20-fold increase of the number of differentially expressed genes, suggesting that TM may enhance the gene response during challenging conditions in female quail hypothalamus. TM may also promote new cellular strategies in females to help coping to the adverse conditions as illustrated by the identification of differentially expressed genes related to the mitochondrial and heat-response functions.',\n",

In eutherian mammals, Sox1, Sox2, and Sox3 participate in central nervous system (CNS) development. Sox15 has a function in skeletal muscle regeneration and has little functional overlap with the other three ohnologs. In contrast, the frog Xenopus laevis and zebrafish orthologs of sox15 as well as sox1-3 function in CNS development. We previously reported that Sox15 is involved in mouse placental development as neofunctionalization, but is pseudogenized in the marsupial opossum. These findings suggest that sox15 might have evolved with divergent gene fates during vertebrate evolution. However, knowledge concerning sox15 in other vertebrate lineages than therian mammals, anuran amphibians, and teleost fish is scarce. Our purpose in this study was to clarify the fate and molecular evolution of sox15 during vertebrate evolution.',\n",

However, not all sheep breeds suffering from yellow fat have this nonsense mutation, meaning that other functional mechanisms must exist. We investigated one such breed, the Norwegian spælsau.,In spælsau we detected an aberration in BCO2 mRNA. Nanopore sequencing of genomic DNA revealed the insertion of a 7.9 kb endogenous Jaagsiekte Sheep Retrovirus (enJSRV) sequence in the first intron of the BCO2 gene. Close examination of its cDNA revealed that the BCO2 genes first exon was spliced together with enJSRV-sequence immediately downstream of a potential -AG splice acceptor site at enJSRV position 415. The hybrid protein product consists of 29 amino acids coded by the BCO2 exon 1, one amino acid coded by the junction sequence, followed by 28 amino acids arbitrary coded for by the enJSRV-sequence, before a translation stop codon is reached.,Considering that the functional BCO2 protein consists of 575 amino acids, it is unlikely that the 58 amino acid BCO2/enJSRV hybrid protein can display any enzymatic function. The existence of this novel BCO2 allele represents an alternative functional mechanism accounting for BCO2 inactivation and is a perfect example of the potential benefits for searching for structural variants using long-read sequencing data.',\n",

To improve crop resistance, many studies have focused on understanding the mechanisms of host defense against these two fungi individually. However, our knowledge of the common and different host defenses against these pathogens is very limited.,In this study, we employed Brachypodium distachyon as a model for cereal crops and performed comparative transcriptomics to study the dynamics of host gene expression at different infection stages. We found that infection with either F. graminearum or M. oryzae triggered massive transcriptomic reprogramming in the diseased tissues. Numerous defense-related genes were induced with dynamic changes during the time course of infection, including genes that function in pattern detection, MAPK cascade, phytohormone signaling, transcription, protein degradation, and secondary metabolism. In particular, the expression of jasmonic acid signaling genes and proteasome component genes were likely specifically inhibited or manipulated upon infection by F. graminearum.,Our analysis showed that, although the affected host pathways are similar, their expression programs and regulations are distinct during infection by F. graminearum and M. oryzae. The results provide valuable insight into the interactions between B. distachyon and two important cereal pathogens.',\n",

The goal of this study was to identify and validate stable reference genes applicable to cord blood samples obtained from developing neonates of different gestational age groups as well as to adult peripheral blood samples. Eight reference gene candidates (ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, GUSB, HPRT, PPIB, RPLP0, RPL13) were analyzed using the three published software algorithms Bestkeeper, GeNorm and NormFinder.,A normalization factor consisting of ACTB and PPIB allows for comparative expression analyses of neonatal samples from different gestational age groups. Normalization factors consisting of GAPDH and PPIB or ACTB and GAPDH are suitable when samples from preterm and full-term neonates and adults are compared. However, all candidate reference genes except RPLP0 exhibited significant intergroup gene expression variance and a higher gene expression towards an older age which resulted in a small but statistically significant systematic bias. Systematic analysis of RNA-seq data revealed new reference gene candidates with potentially superior stability.,The current study identified suitable normalization factors and proposed the use of the additional single gene RPLP0 to avoid systematic bias. This combination will enable comparative analyses not only between neonates of different gestational ages, but also between neonates and adults, as it facilitates more detailed investigations of developmental gene expression changes. The use of software algorithms did not prevent unintended systematic bias. This generally highlights the need for careful validation of such results to prevent false interpretation of potential age-dependent changes in gene expression. To identify the most stable reference genes in the future, RNA-seq based global approaches are recommended.',\n",
              " 'Outbreaks of insect pests in paddy fields cause heavy losses in global rice yield annually, a threat projected to be aggravated by ongoing climate warming. Although significant progress has been made in the screening and cloning of insect resistance genes in rice germplasm and their introgression into modern cultivars, improved rice resistance is only effective against either chewing or phloem-feeding insects.,In this study, the results from standard and modified seedbox screening, settlement preference and honeydew excretion tests consistently showed that Qingliu, a previously known leaffolder-resistant rice variety, is also moderately resistant to brown planthopper (BPH). High-throughput RNA sequencing showed a higher number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the infestation site, with 2720 DEGs in leaves vs 181 DEGs in sheaths for leaffolder herbivory and 450 DEGs in sheaths vs 212 DEGs in leaves for BPH infestation. The leaf-specific transcriptome revealed that Qingliu responds to leaffolder feeding by activating jasmonic acid biosynthesis genes and genes regulating the shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways that are essential for the biosynthesis of salicylic acid, melatonin, flavonoids and lignin defensive compounds. The sheath-specific transcriptome revealed that Qingliu responds to BPH infestation by inducing salicylic acid-responsive genes and those controlling cellular signaling cascades. Taken together these genes could play a role in triggering defense mechanisms such as cell wall modifications and cuticular wax formation.,This study highlighted the key defensive responses of a rarely observed rice variety Qingliu that has resistance to attacks by two different feeding guilds of herbivores. The leaffolders are leaf-feeder while the BPHs are phloem feeders, consequently Qingliu is considered to have dual resistance. Although the defense responses of Qingliu to both insect pest types appear largely dissimilar, the phenylpropanoid pathway (or more specifically phenylalanine ammonia-lyase genes) could be a convergent upstream pathway. However, this possibility requires further studies. This information is valuable for breeding programs aiming to generate broad spectrum insect resistance in rice cultivars.',\n",
              " 'An increasing number of studies have shown that lncRNAs are crucial for the control of hormones and the regulation of various physiological processes in the human body, and deletion mutations in RNA are related to many human diseases. LncRNA- disease association prediction is very useful for understanding pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prevention of diseases, and is helpful for labelling relevant biological information.,In this manuscript, we propose a computational model named bidirectional generative adversarial network (BiGAN), which consists of an encoder, a generator, and a discriminator to predict new lncRNA-disease associations. We construct features between lncRNA and disease pairs by utilizing the disease semantic similarity, lncRNA sequence similarity, and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarities of lncRNAs and diseases. The BiGAN maps the latent features of similarity features to predict unverified association between lncRNAs and diseases. The computational results have proved that the BiGAN performs significantly better than other state-of-the-art approaches in cross-validation. We employed the proposed model to predict candidate lncRNAs for renal cancer and colon cancer. The results are promising. Case studies show that almost 70% of lncRNAs in the top 10 prediction lists are verified by recent biological research.,The experimental results indicated that our proposed model had an accurate predictive ability for the association of lncRNA-disease pairs.',\n",
              " 'Pantothenic acid deficiency (PAD) results in growth depression and intestinal hypofunction of animals. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Mucosal proteome might reflect dietary influences on physiological processes.,A total of 128 white Pekin ducks of one-day-old were randomly assigned to two groups, fed either a PAD or a pantothenic acid adequate (control, CON) diet. After a 16-day feeding period, two ducks from each replicate were sampled to measure plasma parameters, intestinal morphology, and mucosal proteome. Compared to the CON group, high mortality, growth retardation, fasting hypoglycemia, reduced plasma insulin, and oxidative stress were observed in the PAD group. Furthermore, PAD induced morphological alterations of the small intestine indicated by reduced villus height and villus surface area of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The duodenum mucosal proteome of ducks showed that 198 proteins were up-regulated and 223 proteins were down-regulated (> 1.5-fold change) in the PAD group compared to those in the CON group. Selected proteins were confirmed by Western blotting. Pathway analysis of these proteins exhibited the suppression of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, fatty acid beta oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative stress, and intestinal absorption in the PAD group, indicating impaired energy generation and abnormal intestinal absorption. We also show that nine out of eleven proteins involved in regulation of actin cytoskeleton were up-regulated by PAD, probably indicates reduced intestinal integrity.,PAD leads to growth depression and intestinal hypofunction of ducks, which are associated with impaired energy generation, abnormal intestinal absorption, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton processes. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of intestinal hypofunction induced by PAD.',\n",
              " 'Circadian patterns of migraine attacks have been reported by patients but remain understudied. In animal models, circadian phases are generally not taken into consideration. In particular, rodents are nocturnal animals, yet they are most often tested during their inactive phase during the day. This study aims to test the validity of CGRP-induced behavioral changes in mice by comparing responses during the active and inactive phases.,Male and female mice of the outbred CD1 strain were administered vehicle (PBS) or CGRP (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) to induce migraine-like symptoms. Animals were tested for activity (homecage movement and voluntary wheel running), light aversive behavior, and spontaneous pain at different times of the day and night.,Peripheral administration of CGRP decreased the activity of mice during the first hour after administration, induced light aversive behavior, and spontaneous pain during that same period of time. Both phenotypes were observed no matter what time of the day or night they were assessed.,A decrease in wheel activity is an additional clinically relevant phenotype observed in this model, which is reminiscent of the reduction in normal physical activity observed in migraine patients. The ability of peripheral CGRP to induce migraine-like symptoms in mice is independent of the phase of the circadian cycle. Therefore, preclinical assessment of migraine-like phenotypes can likely be done during the more convenient inactive phase of mice.',\n",

A total of 127 consecutive patients with high-energy blunt PRI were included between January 1st, 2014 and December 31st, 2017. Every patient had a total body or thoraco-abdominal computed tomography scan including contrast enhanced arterial sequences. A board-certified radiologist reviewed all the vascular images and precisely described every intra-pelvic arterial lesion in terms of localization. Complete pelvic series (standard radiographs and fine cut computed tomography images) were reviewed by three board-certified orthopedic surgeons experienced in PRI management, and Young and Burgess and AO/OTA classifications were determined. Demographic, clinical, therapeutic and outcome data were extracted from the institutional severely injured patients' registry.,Patients' mean age was 45.3 years and 58.3% were males. Fifteen (11.8%) had a total of 21 intra-pelvic arterial lesions: seven lesions of the obturator artery, four of the superior gluteal artery, three of the inferior gluteal artery, two of the vesical artery, and one of each of the following arteries: internal iliac, internal pudendal, fifth lumbar, lateral sacral, ilio-lumbar. These lesions occurred in 8.6% of lateral compression injuries, 33.3% of anteroposterior compression injuries and 23.5% of vertical shear and combined mechanism injuries (Young and Burgess classification, p = 0.003); and in 0% of type A injuries, 9.9% of type B injuries and 35% of type C injuries (AO/OTA classification, p = 0.001). Patients with an intra-pelvic arterial lesion were more likely to present with pre-hospital hemodynamic instability (p = 0.046) and to need packed red blood cells transfusion within the first 24 h (p = 0.023; they needed a mean of 7.53 units vs. 1.88, p = 0.0016); however, they did not have a worst outcome in terms of complications or mortality.,This systematic study found an 11.8% rate of intra-pelvic arterial lesion related to high-energy blunt PRI. The obturator, superior gluteal and inferior gluteal arteries were most often injured. These findings are important for the aggressive management of high-energy blunt PRI.\",\n",
              " \"The physical environment can facilitate or hinder physical activity. A challenge in promoting physical activity is ensuring that the physical environment is supportive and that these supports are appropriately tailored to the individual or group in question. Ideally, aspects of the environment that impact physical activity would be enhanced, but environmental changes take time, and identifying ways to provide more precision to physical activity recommendations might be helpful for specific individuals or groups. Therefore, moving beyond a one size fits all to a precision-based approach is critical.,To this end, we considered 4 critical aspects of the physical environment that influence physical activity (walkability, green space, traffic-related air pollution, and heat) and how these aspects could enhance our ability to precisely guide physical activity. Strategies to increase physical activity could include optimizing design of the built environment or mitigating of some of the environmental impediments to activity through personalized or population-wide interventions.,Although at present non-personalized approaches may be more widespread than those tailored to one person's physical environment, targeting intrinsic personal elements (e.g., medical conditions, sex, age, socioeconomic status) has interesting potential to enhance the likelihood and ability of individuals to participate in physical activity.\",\n",

The outcomes of this study were the incidences of cardio-metabolic events (type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation).,A total of 94,870 SA patients were matched with 189,740 WE patients. SA were at an increased risk of developing: T2DM (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 3.1; 95% CI 2.97-3.23); HTN (1.34; 95% CI: 1.29-1.39); ischaemic heart disease (IHD) (1.81; 95% CI: 1.68-1.93) and heart failure (HF) (1.11; 95% CI: 1.003-1.24).

Postpartum care significantly impacts on the maternal and neonatal physical and mental health. However, evidence has revealed unmet needs in postpartum maternal care.,The study aimed to explore the experiences of PCPs in managing postpartum mothers.,Four focus group discussions and eleven in-depth interviews with twenty-nine PCPs were conducted in this qualitative research study in urban Singapore. PCPs of both gender and variable postgraduate training background were purposively enrolled. Audited transcripts were independently coded by two investigators. Thematic content analysis was performed using the codes to identify issues in the clinician, mother, postpartum care and healthcare system & policy domains stipulated in The Generalists' Wheel of Knowledge, Understanding and Inquiry framework.,PCPs' personal attributes such as gender and knowledge influenced their postpartum care delivery. Prior training, child caring experience and access to resource materials contributed to their information mastery of postpartum care. Their professional relationship with local multi-ethic and multi-lingual Asian mothers was impacted by their mutual communication, language compatibility and understanding of local confinement practices. Consultation time constraint, awareness of community postnatal services and inadequate handover of care from the specialists hindered PCPs in the healthcare system.,Personal, maternal and healthcare system barriers currently prevent PCPs from delivering optimal postpartum care.,Interventions to overcome the barriers to improve postpartum care will likely be multi-faceted across domains discussed.\",\n",
              " \"Stepping into the role of an unpaid caregiver to offer help is often considered a natural expectation of family members or friends. In Canada, such contributions are substantial in terms of healthcare provision but this comes at a considerable cost to the caregivers in both health and economic terms.,In this study, we conducted a secondary analysis of a collection of qualitative interviews with 39 caregivers of people with chronic physical illness to assess how they described their particular roles in caring for a loved one. We used a model of caregiving roles, originally proposed by Twigg in 1989, as a guide for our analysis, which specified three predominant roles for caregivers - as a resource, as a co-worker, and as a co-client.,The caregivers in this collection spoke about their roles in ways that aligned well with these roles, but they also described tasks and activities that fit best with a fourth role of 'care-coordinator', which required that they assume an oversight role in coordinating care across institutions, care providers and often advocate for care in line with their expectations. For each of these types of roles, we have highlighted the limitations and challenges they described in their interviews.,We argue that a deeper understanding of the different roles that caregivers assume, as well as their challenges, can contribute to the design and implementation of policies and services that would support their contributions and choices as integral members of the care team. We provide some examples of system-level policies and programs from different jurisdictions developed in recognition of the need to sustain caregivers in their role and respond to such limitations.\",\n",
              " \"During pregnancy, nutritional requirements increase and if not met, pregnancy-related complications may manifest. To prevent these undesirable outcomes, the World Health Organization recommends daily oral iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation as part of antenatal care. Despite this recommendation, the use of IFA supplements is still very low in several developing countries. Additionally, no prior information exists regarding the level of consumption of IFA in Eswatini. Thus, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of consumption of IFA supplements and to identify factors associated with the consumption of IFA supplements among pregnant women in Eswatini.,A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted among 330 pregnant women aged = 18 years in their third trimester in Eswatini. Participants were recruited from eight purposively selected healthcare facilities from July 2019 to October 2019. Good consumption was defined as consuming all or almost all IFA supplements throughout pregnancy.,During the first trimester, 10.3 % of the participants consumed all or almost all IFA supplements. In the second and third trimesters, those who consumed all or almost all supplements were 37 and 39.7 %, respectively, for iron and 37.6 and 40.9 %, respectively, for folic acid. Barriers, including side effects, forgetfulness, safe previous pregnancies without IFA, others' advice against consumption, IFA stock-outs, inability to meet transport costs, and inadequate supply of IFA tablets, contribute to low consumption of IFA. Multivariate logistic regression models showed that the barriers were inversely associated with good consumption of IFA supplements. Better knowledge and attitude toward IFA and older maternal age were positively associated with good consumption of IFA supplements.,Low consumption of IFA supplements in overall pregnancy is mainly owing to the late antenatal care attendance. Strategies such as establishing a preconception care unit and school-based provision of IFA may be helpful. It is evident that most women still lack knowledge, and some have negative attitudes about IFA supplements. Health education to raise awareness and emphasize the importance of starting antenatal care early as well as consuming supplements on time should be revisited and intensified. Multiple strategies such as including community health care workers for distributing IFA supplements, discussing with clients about the measures to reduce forgetfulness, advising ways to prevent and manage the side effects, providing subsidies to cover transport costs, and ensuring adequate supply of IFA supplements in facilities may need to be employed to reduce the identified barriers.\",\n",

Early recognition of psittacosis is difficult because of its nonspecific clinical manifestations. Culture and gene probe techniques for C. psittaci are not available for routine clinical use, which makes the diagnosis difficult too. Although psittacosis has increasingly been recognized and reported in recent years, cure of severe pneumonia complicated with meningitis, with etiologic diagnosis aided by the use of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), is still uncommon. So, it is necessary to report and review such potentially fatal case.,This report describes a 54-year-old woman with C. psittaci caused severe atypical pneumonia and meningitis. She presented with symptoms of fever, dry cough and dyspnea, accompanied by prominent headache. Her condition deteriorated rapidly to respiratory failure and lethargy under the treatment of empirical antibacterial agents, and was treated with invasive mechanical ventilation soon. She denied contact with birds, poultry or horses, but unbiased mNGS of both the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) identified sequence reads corresponding to C. psittaci infection, and there was no sequence read corresponding to other probable pathogens. Combined use of targeted antimicrobial agents of tetracyclines, macrolides and fluoroquinolones was carried out, and the patient's condition improved and she was discharged home 28 days later. Her status returned close to premorbid condition on day 60 of follow-up.,When clinicians come across a patient with atypical pneumonia accompanied by symptoms of meningitis, psittacosis should be taken into consideration. mNGS is a promising detection method in such condition and is recommended.\",\n",

Factors independently associated with longer time to initiation of breastfeeding were older maternal age (AOR = 1.04, 95%CI: 1.00-1.09, p = 0.039), Akan ethnicity (AOR = 1.92, 95%CI: 1.14-3.22, p = 0.014), first-born child (AOR = 2.06, 95%CI: 1.18-3.58, p = 0.011), mother rooming-in with newborn (AOR = 0.01. 95%CI: 0.00-0.02, p < \\xa00.001), increasing fifth minute APGAR score (AOR = 0.73, 95%CI: 0.58-0.93, p = 0.010) and using prelacteals (AOR = 2.42, 95%CI: 1.34-4.40, p = 0.004).,The low EIBF rate and prolonged time to initiation of breastfeeding at a major tertiary health facility is a major concern. Key interventions will need to be implemented at KATH and possibly other tertiary healthcare facilities in Ghana and beyond to improve EIBF rate and time to breastfeeding.',\n",

Since we have developed a highly sensitive ATP assay system, we examined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ATP levels in patients with ALS whether it can be a useful biomarker in ALS.,Forty-eight CSF samples from 44 patients with ALS were assayed for ATP with a newly established, highly sensitive assay system using luciferase luminous reaction. CSF samples from patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) were assayed as a control. Patients were divided into two groups depending on their disease severity, as evaluated using the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score. Correlations between the CSF ATP levels and other factors, including clinical data and serum creatinine levels, were evaluated.,CSF ATP levels were significantly higher in patients with ALS than in the iNPH (716 ± 411 vs. 3635 ± 5465\\xa0pmol/L, p < 0.01). CSF ATP levels were significantly higher in the more severe group than in the iNPH group (6860 ± 8312 vs. 716 ± 411\\xa0pmol/L, p < 0.05) and mild group (6860 ± 8312 vs. 2676 ± 3959\\xa0pmol/L, p < 0.05) respectively. ALS functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) (37.9 ± 5.7 vs. 42.4 ± 2.8, p < 0.01) and serum creatinine levels (0.51 ± 0.13 vs. 0.68 ± 0.23\\xa0mg/dL, p < 0.05) were significantly lower in the severe group than in the mild group respectively. A negative correlation of CSF ATP levels with MRC sum score was demonstrated in the correlation analysis adjusted for age and sex (r = -0.3, p = 0.08).,Extracellular ATP is particularly increased in the CSF of patients with advanced ALS. CSF ATP levels may be a useful biomarker for evaluating disease severity in patients with ALS.\",\n",

Our previous study reported that ?d T cells producing IL-17 were involved in the pathogenesis of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS). However, their subset characteristic profile in this kind of disease remains unclear. Thus the current study's aim is to investigate the functionally predominant subset and its role in PI-IBS.,The total T cells were collected from the peripheral blood of patients with PI-IBS. The peripheral proportion of Vd1 and Vd2 subset was detected by FACS after stained with anti d1-PE and anti d2-APC. The local colonic proportion of this two subsets were measured under laser confocal fluorescence microscope. Vd1 ?d T cells were enriched from the total peripheral T cells by minoantibody-immuno-microbeads (MACS) method and cultured, functionally evaluated by CCK-8 assay (proliferation), CD69/CD62L molecules expression assay (activation) and ELISA (IL-17 production) respectively.,1. Vd1 ?d T cells significantly increased while Vd2 ?d T cells remained unchanged in both the peripheral blood and local colonic tissue from PI-IBS patients (p < 0.05). 2. When cultured in vitro, the Vd1 ?d T cells remarkably proliferated, activated and produced IL-17 (p < 0.05).,Our results suggest that Vd1 ?d T cells was the predominant ?d T cells subset in both peripheral and intestinal tissue, and was the major IL-17 producing ?d T cells in PI-IBS.\",\n",

              " 'Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected tropical disease, which mainly affects poor communities. It is one of the major vector-borne disease and endemic in Pakistan.,A case-control study to evaluate potential risk factors of human-CL was conducted in Khewra region, District Jhelum, Pakistan from January-April 2014. Case data about 90 cases registered during October 2012 to November 2013 was retrieved from Municipal Hospital. Controls were matched (1,1 ratio) on the date of registration with cases from same hospital. Both cases and controls were invited to participate and data was collected in a face-to-face interview. A prospective study of canine leishmaniasis (canine-CL) was also conducted at Civil Veterinary Hospital in the same area. Suspected dogs with skin ulceration signs were included in the study and blood samples were collected. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine association between various parameters and outcome of interest.,The ages of cases ranged from 1 to 76 years (median = 15 years) and proved to be protective factor i.e. increase in each year in age reduced the likelihood of being infected with human-CL [Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.4, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.25-0.76]. People sleeping outsides in an open area were more likely to become a case (OR = 8.7, 95% CI = 2.90-26.37) than a control. Poor sanitary condition inside the house (OR = 3.3, 95% CI 1.03-10.56) and presence of other animals in house (livestock, poultry) (OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.07-12.12) also identified as risk factors of high significance. The proportion of positive dogs with canine-CL was 21.05% and was significantly associated with human-CL cases in the same area (p < 0.05).,We concluded that adopting self-protections measures against sand-fly, and maintaining good hygiene may lower the risk of human-CL. One-Health Strategy is suggested to control leishmaniasis in human and dog population.',\n",

Thermo Fisher Scientific is a relatively new company in the molecular diagnostics field and the purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the Thermo Fisher TaqPath™ Combo Kit with an established test, the Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay, for its ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens.,A total of 300 randomly selected nasopharyngeal specimens were evaluated and tested by the TaqPath and GeneXpert assays. Discordant test specimens were arbitrated by performing an alternative PCR assay and Sanger sequencing.,The TaqPath assay had a 96.7 and 99.6% positive and negative agreement respectively when compared to the Xpert Xpress test. However, after test arbitration, the three discordant specimens were arbitrated in favor of the TaqPath assay producing a positive and negative percent agreement of 100% for the TaqPath Combo Kit while the Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay had a positive and negative percent agreement of 98.3 and 99.2% respectively.,The TaqPath Combo Kit is a high complexity assay that compares favorably with the Xpert Xpress test and can be reliably used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens.',\n",
              " \"Bacteroides dorei is an anaerobic gram-negative bacterium first described in 2006. Because of the high similarity in mass spectra between B. dorei and Bacteroides vulgatus, discriminating between these species is arduous in clinical practice. In recent decades, 16S rRNA gene sequencing has been a complementary method for distinguishing taxonomically close bacteria, including B. dorei and B. vulgatus, at the genus and species levels. Consequently, B. dorei has been shown to contribute to some diseases, including type 1 autoimmune diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic diseases. However, there are no reports on invasive infectious diseases caused by B. dorei. This report describes the first case of direct invasion and colonisation of human tissue by B. dorei, thus providing a warning regarding the previously proposed application of B. dorei as a live biotherapeutic for atherosclerotic diseases.,A 78-year-old Japanese man complained of intermittent chest/back pain and was diagnosed with a mycotic thoracic aortic aneurysm by enhanced computed tomography on admission. Despite strict blood pressure control and empirical antibiotic therapy, the patient's condition worsened. To prevent aneurysmal rupture and eliminate infectious foci, the patient underwent surgical treatment. The resected specimen was subjected to tissue culture and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis to identify pathogenic bacteria. A few days after the surgery, culture and sequencing results revealed that the pathogen was B. dorei/B. vulgatus and B. dorei, respectively. The patient was successfully treated with appropriate antibacterial therapy and after improvement, was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation on postoperative day 34. There was no recurrence of infection or aneurysm after the patient transfer.,This report describes the first case of invasive infectious disease caused by B. dorei, casting a shadow over its utilisation as a probiotic for atherosclerotic diseases.\",\n",
              " 'Body movement-controlled video games involving physical motion and visual attention may have the potential to train both abilities simultaneously. Our purpose was to determine the associations between performance in these games and visual attention, balance and mobility in a group of older adults. The long-term goal is to identify the optimal type of interactive games with regards to training potential.,Fifty healthy adults aged 65+ years participated in this cross-sectional study. Visual attention was measured with static and dynamic versions of a useful field of view (UFV) and a multiple object tracking (MOT) test. Balance was measured with a force plate in bi-pedal quiet stance test (QST) and one-legged stance (OLST). Gait variability and walking speed were assessed with the Five Meter Walk Test (5MWT). Four Microsoft™ Xbox® 360 Kinect™ interactive video games were chosen based on the apparent levels of visual attention demand.,Visual attention (UFV and MOT) was significantly associated with performance in Xbox® Kinect™ games that appeared to have a high visual attention demand (p < 0.05), while there was minimal or no significant association with games with apparent low visual attention demand. Balance and mobility show correlations with visual attention, and with Xbox games.,The results suggest that there are relationships between visual attention, balance, mobility and Xbox® Kinect™ game performance. Since different Xbox® games were associated with different balance, mobility and visual attention scores, a variety of such games, rather than a single game, may be most effective for training for falls prevention.',\n",
              " \"Considering the global refugee crisis, there is an increasing demand on primary care physicians to be able to adequately assess and address the health care needs of individual refugees, including both the somatic and psychiatric spectra. Meanwhile, intercultural consultations are often described as challenging, and studies exploring physician-patient communication focusing on emotional distress are lacking. Therefore, the aim was to explore physician-patient communication, with focus on cultural aspects of emotional distress in intercultural primary care consultations, using a grounded theory approach, considering both the physician's and the patient's perspective.,The study was set in Region Stockholm, Sweden. In total, 23 individual interviews and 3 focus groups were conducted. Resident physicians in family medicine and patients with refugee backgrounds, originating from Somalia, Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, were included. Data was analysed using a grounded theory approach.,Over time, primary care patients with refugee backgrounds seemed to adopt a culturally congruent model of emotional distress. Gradual acceptance of psychiatric diagnoses as explanatory models for distress and suffering was noted, which is in line with current tendencies in Sweden. This acculturation might be influenced by the physician. Three possible approaches used by residents in intercultural consultations were identified: biomedical, didactic and compensatory. They all indicated that diagnoses are culturally valid models to explain various forms of distress and may thus contribute to shifting patient perceptions of psychiatric diagnoses.,Physicians working in Swedish primary care may influence patients' acculturation process by inadvertently shifting their perceptions of psychiatric diagnoses. Residents expressed concerns, rather than confidence, in dealing with these issues. Focusing part of their training on how to address emotional distress in an intercultural context would likely be beneficial for all parties concerned.\",\n",
              " 'Since the early descriptions of large series of accessory atrioventricular pathway ablations in adults and adolescents over 20\\xa0years ago, there have been limited published reports based on more recent experiences of large referral centers. We aimed to characterize accessory pathway distribution and features in a large community-based population that influence ablation outcomes using a tiered approach to ablation.,Retrospective analysis of 289 patients (age 14-81) who underwent accessory ablation from 2015-2019 was performed. Pathways were categorized into anteroseptal, left freewall, posteroseptal, and right freewall locations. We analyzed patient and pathway features to identify factors associated with prolonged procedure time parameters.,Initial ablation success rate was 94.7% with long-term success rate of 93.4% and median follow-up of 931\\xa0days. Accessory pathways were in left freewall (61.6%), posteroseptal (24.6%), right freewall (9.6%), and anteroseptal (4.3%) locations. Procedure outcome was dependent on pathway location. Acute success was highest for left freewall pathways (97.1%) with lowest case times (144 ± 68\\xa0min) and fluoroscopy times (15 ± 19\\xa0min). Longest procedure time parameters were seen with anteroseptal, left anterolateral, epicardial-coronary sinus, and right anterolateral pathway ablations.,In this community-based adult and adolescent population, majority of the accessory pathways are in the left freewall and posteroseptal region and tend to be more easily ablated. A tiered approach with initial use of standard ablation equipment before the deployment of more advance tools, such as irrigated tips and 3D mapping, is cost effective without sacrificing overall efficacy.',\n",
              " \"Although abuse experienced by older adults is common and expected to increase, disclosure, reporting and interventions to prevent or mitigate abuse remain sub-optimal. Incorporating principles of harm reduction into service provision has been advocated as a strategy that may improve outcomes for this population. This paper explores whether and how these principles of harm reduction were employed by professionals who provide services to older adults experiencing abuse.,Thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with 23 professionals providing services to older adults experiencing abuse across three Western provinces of Canada was conducted. Key principles of harm reduction (humanism, incrementalism, individualism, pragmatism, autonomy, and accountability without termination) were used as a framework for organizing the themes.,Our analysis illustrated a clear congruence between each of the six harm reduction principles and the approaches reflected in the narratives of professionals who provided services to this population, although these were not explicitly articulated as harm reduction by participants. Each of the harm reduction principles was evident in service providers' description of their professional practice with abused older adults, although some principles were emphasized differentially at different phases of the disclosure and intervention process. Enactment of a humanistic approach formed the basis of the therapeutic client-provider relationships with abused older adults, with incremental, individual, and pragmatic principles also apparent in the discourse of participants. While respect for the older adult's autonomy figured prominently in the data, concerns about the welfare of the older adults with questionable capacity were expressed when they did not engage with services or chose to return to a high-risk environment. Accountability without termination of the client-provider relationship was reflected in continuation of support regardless of the decisions made by the older adult experiencing abuse.,Harm reduction approaches are evident in service providers' accounts of working with older adults experiencing abuse. While further refinement of the operational definitions of harm reduction principles specific to their application with older adults is still required, this harm reduction framework aligns well with both the ethical imperatives and the practical realities of supporting older adults experiencing abuse.\",\n",

Therefore, the dental teams need to be equipped with specific knowledge and skills to provide the appropriate dental care. This study was iaimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, practice and willingness of general dentists to provide dental care to geriatric patients.,This cross-sectional study was conducted on 231 dentists using a questionnaire including demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitude and practice sections. The availability of the facilities for providing services to the older people in the office was also evaluated. Data were fed into SPSS-22 and analysed using descriptive statistics, t-test, Chi-squared, ANOVA and correlation coefficient tests (a = 0.05).,62.8% of the participants were women and their mean age was 34. 4±8. 1 years. The knowledge mean score was 13.3± 2.9 (out of 30). 86. 5% of the participants had moderate knowledge, and 2.6% displayed good knowledge. The mean score related to the attitudes toward geriatric was 55.8 ± 6. 1 (out of 85), which was not significantly different based on gender. The mean score of practice was 21. 4± 4.3. There was a significantly positive correlation between knowledge and attitude. Dentists with a higher knowledge score had moderately a more positive attitude towards the older people (R = 0.33, p_ value < 0.001). However, over 60% preferred to provide care to the young patients. Significant correlation was observed between their practice and attitude (R = 0. 2, P-value = 0.006). Nearly 30% of the dentists found their knowledge and experience insufficient in treating the older people with complex medical problems. 40% believed that the current dental education in dental schools did not provide adequate training in geriatric dental care.,Although the dentists in this study had average knowledge and capacity, they mostly displayed a positive attitude towards the old.

In addition to cosmetic effects and loss of stereoscopic function, IXT may negatively impact the psychological well-being of children and their parents. The purpose of this study was to assess the patient-reported outcomes of Chinese children with IXT before and after strabismus surgery.,The records of children with IXT who underwent strabismus surgery at the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center of Sun Yat-sen University, China over the period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018 were prospectively recruited. All children underwent ophthalmic and orthoptic examinations, including the prism and alternate cover test, fusion function by synoptophore, stereoacuity and Newcastle control score. Two patient-reported outcome measures were used: the intermittent Exotropia Questionnaire (IXTQ) to measure disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to measure anxiety and depression. Patient-reported outcome measurements were made before and after surgery with responses from children and their parents.,A total of 389 children were eligible for inclusion (47.8% male, 52.2% female, mean + SD age = 8.17 ± 2.81). Preoperative IXTQ scores in both children (48.21 ± 26.2) and their parents (44.6 ± 25.68) were significantly correlated with near stereoacuity (P = 0.029 and P = 0.015, respectively). The angle of deviation at near vision showed a negative linear relationship with visual function (P = 0.026) and psychological (P = 0.019) scores as well as opinions regarding surgery (P = 0.024). HADS scores (anxiety scale score: 11 ± 2.92, depression scale score: 10.44 ± 2.9) were also related to near stereoacuity (P < 0.05). After surgery, both children's (74.83 ± 16.59) and parents' (68.57 ± 17.06) IXTQ scores significantly improved (p<0.01). Children's IXTQ scores were related to the angle of deviation at distance, and their psychological and visual function scores showed a negative relationship with the angle of deviation at near vision (P < 0.05).,Children and parents' HRQOL and HADS were associated with near stereoacuity. Parents usually attend more readily to the angle of deviation at near in their IXT children. HRQOL improved significantly after surgery and can be used as one of the indices for preoperative evaluation but is not recommended as a criterion for surgical intervention.\",\n",

In adult CHD patients with successful surgical repair, cardiac complications including heart failure develop at late stage, likely due to genetic causes. To date, many mutations in cardiac developmental genes have been associated with CHD. Recently, regulatory variants in genes have been linked to many human diseases. Although mutations and splicing variants in GATA4 gene have been reported in CHD patients, few regulatory variants of GATA4 gene are identified in CHD patients.,GATA4 gene regulatory region was investigated in the patients with atrial septal defects (ASD) (n = 332) and ethnic-matched controls (n = 336).,Five heterozygous regulatory variants including four SNPs [g.31360\\xa0T>C (rs372004083), g.31436G>A, g.31437C>A (rs769262495), g.31487C>G (rs1053351749) and g.31856C>T (rs1385460518)] were only identified in ASD patients. Functional analysis indicated that the regulatory variants significantly affected the transcriptional activity of GATA4 gene promoter. Furthermore, two of the five regulatory variants have evidently effected on transcription factor binding sites.,Our data suggested that GATA4 gene regulatory variants may confer ASD susceptibility by decreasing GATA4 levels.',\n",

Patients aged =70 years who died between April 1, 2016, and March 31, 2017, were included (N = 16,084 patients; mean age = 85.1 ± 7.5 years; 7804 men (48.5%) and 8280 women (51.5%)). The outcome measures were medical expenditures (inpatient, outpatient, and prescription), long-term care expenditures, and total healthcare expenditures (the sum of medical and long-term care expenditures) during the 60 months before the date of death. We calculated each patient's monthly medical and long-term care expenditures for 60 months before the date of death and applied group-based trajectory modeling to identify distinct trajectories. Factors associated with spending trajectories were examined via multinomial logistic regression analyses. Explanatory variables included age, sex, diseases, and the medical services used.,We identified six distinct spending trajectories for the total healthcare expenditures: high persistent (45.6%), medium-to-high persistent (26.1%), early rise then high persistent (9.8%), late rise (6.4%), low persistent then very late rise (i.e., when spending starts increasing later than late rise; 6.4%), and progressive increase (5.7%). Factors associated with the high-persistent trajectory were chronic illnesses, various organ failures, neurodegenerative diseases, fractures, and tube feeding. The trajectory pattern of medical expenditures was similar to that of total healthcare expenditures; however, a different pattern was seen for long-term care expenditures.,Regarding combined medical and long-term care spending of the last 5 years, most patients belonged to a pattern in which the healthcare expenditures remained high, and a combination of multiple factors contributed to these patterns. This finding can offer healthcare providers a longer-term perspective on end-of-life care.\",\n",

Different brief assessment instruments have been developed as efficacy measures of geriatric anxiety in order to overcome psychometric weaknesses of its long form. Among these, the 10-item Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS-10) showed strong psychometric properties in community-dwelling samples. However, its diagnostic accuracy is still unexplored, as well as its discriminative power in clinical samples.,In the present study, we explored the psychometric performance of the GAS-10 in the elderly through Item Response Theory in a sample of 1200 Italian community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly adults (53.8% males, mean age = 65.21 ± 9.19 years). Concurrent validity, as well as diagnostic accuracy, was examined in a non-clinical sample (N = 229; 46.72% males) and clinical sample composed of 35 elderly outpatients (74.28% females) with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).,The GAS-10 displayed good internal construct validity, with unidimensional structure and no local dependency, good accuracy, and no signs of Differential Item Functioning (DIF) or measurement bias due to gender, but negligible due to the age. Differences in concurrent validity and diagnostic accuracy among the long form version of the GAS and the GAS-10 were not found significant. The GAS-10 may be more useful than the longer versions in many clinical and research applications, when time constraints or fatigue are issues.,Using the ROC curve, the GAS-10 showed good discriminant validity in categorizing outpatients with GAD disorder, and high anxiety symptoms as measured by the GAS-SF cut-off. The stable cut-off point provided could enhance the clinical usefulness of the GAS-10, which seems to be a promising valid and reliable tool for maximize diagnostic accuracy of geriatric anxiety symptoms.\",\n",

There were 16 (34%) deaths, and most frequent causes were acute ILD exacerbation and pneumonia. MR was 64.3 [39.4-104.9], and 50% of the patients died at 8.3\\xa0years from ILD diagnosis. After adjusting for confounders, (UIP compared to NSIP was associated with higher mortality risk. The overall SMR was 2.57 [1.4-4.17]. Women of 60-75\\xa0years of age were the group with the highest SMR.,RA-ILD is associated with an excess of mortality compared to general population. Our results support that UIP increases the risk of mortality in RA-ILD, regardless other factors.',\n",
              " \"The Swedish healthcare is decentralised to 21 regions. Detailed information on all delivered care in the southernmost region, Skåne, is prospectively collected in the Skåne Healthcare Register (SHR). The data is updated daily and hence a good source for epidemiological studies. However, the diagnostic codes used to identify cancer patients in SHR have not yet been validated.,We conducted a validation study including 1,473,204 residents in Skåne region during 2005-2014, with at least one physical consultation in SHR. Newly diagnosed cancer from the Swedish Cancer Register was considered the 'gold standard' reference. We estimated the positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, and area under the curve (AUC) of a cancer diagnosis based on SHR by level of consultation, for any cancer, and for different cancer types.,There were 61,693 cancers from the Swedish Cancer Register, and 87,650 cancers from SHR. The PPV of SHR-based diagnosis of any cancer was 63.76% (95% confidence interval (CI): 63.44-64.08%) with a sensitivity of 90.58% (95% CI: 90.35-90.81%). The AUC was 0.94, for any cancer. The measures of PPV, sensitivity and AUC varied across levels of care and were higher in specialized care than in primary care. The highest PPV was observed for specialist inpatient care in SHR (89.17, 95% CI 88.89-89.45%) whereas the highest sensitivity was observed for specialized outpatient care in SHR (86.39, 95%CI 86.12-86.66%). Robust validity was noted among most cancers, except for cancers of soft tissues, central nervous system and eye, and endocrine glands.,Our study supports that SHR is a valid and robust healthcare register for cancer diagnosis, with varying validities across levels of care and cancer types. This makes SHR a useful data source for cancer epidemiological studies, especially because the data covers the entire cancer care pathways without time lags for further linkage.\",\n",

It was also revealed that maternal age, education level, place of residence, wealth index and timing of ANC services were significantly associated with blood pressure check-ups. The study recommends the need to explore significant factors associated with utilization of available free reproductive health services across all public health facilities. It also recommends the need to address prioritized intensive awareness programs and behavioral change interventions on the significance of BP check-ups among pregnant women of reproductive age.',\n",

MAP supports the population whose household income is lower than 40% of the median Korean household income. We defined poverty as being a MAP beneficiary and compared the poverty and non-poverty groups. Patients between 28 days and 18 years old who were admitted to the ICU were included. Hospital mortality and readmission were analyzed with adjustment for patient characteristics, hospital type, and management procedures.,Out of 17,893 patients, 1153 (6.4%) patients were in poverty. The age-standardized ICU admission rate was higher in the poverty group (126.9 vs. 80.2 per 100,000 person-years).

The present study aimed to assess sleep quality and its associated factors among community non-medical anti-epidemic workers.,A survey was conducted using anonymous online questionnaire to collect information from 16 March 2020 to 24 March 2020. A total of 474 participants were included, with a 94.23% completion rate. The questionnaire contained demographic data, physical symptoms, and contact history with COVID-19. The researchers assessed perceived social support by the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), assessed perceived stress by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and measured sleep quality by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire.,Among the participants, 46.20% reported poor sleep quality. A binary logistic regression revealed that having educational background of junior college or above, being a member of the police force, having contacted individuals with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection, having chronic disease(s), having illness within 2 weeks, and having high or moderate perceived stress were significant factors associated with an increased risk of poor sleep quality.,Demographic factors, physical symptoms, history of contact with COVID-19, and perceived stress are significantly associated with poor sleep quality of community non-medical anti-epidemic workers.

Teachers are role models in the classroom and within the community, and their attitudes and behavior towards people living with HIV may have critical psychosocial and treatment ramifications. Altering teachers' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs (K/A/B) about HIV could reduce the stigmatizing content within their teaching, classrooms and school, improving the environment for ALWH.,We developed a one-day teacher training module to enrich teacher K/A/B that included lecture presentations, HIV films and educational animation, structured instructions for teacher role play scenarios, and a question-and-answer session facilitated by a trained ALWH peer educator. We also conducted key informant interviews with education sector subject matter experts (SMEs), including education officers, county commissioners and head teachers to review and provide feedback on the teacher training module.,We assembled an adolescent community advisory board and recruited 50 SMEs to review the training module and provide feedback. All SME participants stressed the importance and need for interventions to reduce stigma in the classroom, highlighting their own experiences observing stigmatizing behaviors in the community. The participants perceived the training as culturally relevant and easy to understand and had minor suggestions for improvement, including using image-based resources and brighter colors for ease of reading. All participants thought that the training should be expanded outside of the schools, as all people in a community have a role in the reduction of HIV stigma, and offered suggestions for other settings for implementation.,Data from interviews with education sector stakeholders demonstrate that our process for developing a culturally appropriate multi-media intervention to reduce HIV stigma in the schools was feasible.\",\n",

This study evaluates the effect of a community-based intervention aimed at increasing participation in the screening program among women from these two groups.,The intervention consisted of an oral 20-25 min presentation in Urdu and Somali on cervical cancer and screening and practical information on how to make an appointment and payment for the test. The participants were invited to pose questions related to the topic after the presentation. This study was carried out in four geographical areas surrounding the capital Oslo between February and October 2017, among women aged 25-69 years from Pakistan and Somalia. We recruited women in the intervention group directly from different community institutions, households, and religious sites. Women from Pakistan and Somalia residing in Oslo were the controls. The absolute intervention effect was measured as difference in absolute proportion of women screened and estimated as the interaction between time and group allocation in a generalized estimation equation model with binomial distribution and identity link function.,The percentage of women screened in the intervention group increased, from 46 to 51%. The corresponding increase in proportion in the control group was from 44 to 45.5%. After adjustment for potential confounders the intervention group showed a significant larger increase in participation in the screening program as compared to the control group with an absolute difference in change in proportion screened of 0.03 (95% CI; 0.02- 0.06).,Our findings suggest that theory-based, culturally and linguistically sensitive educational interventions can raise awareness and motivate immigrant women to participate in cervical cancer screening program.

Logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations were used to assess the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of individual, partner, and partnership characteristics associated with consistent condom use (CCU). A participant was defined as consistently using condom if they reported always using condoms all the time they had insertive, receptive or both types of anal sex with a male partner.,At the individual level, CCU was positively associated with higher education, disclosure of key population status to a healthcare worker and negatively associated with poor access to condoms. At the partner and partnership level, CCU was associated with partners with higher education (aOR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.07-1.72), casual relationships (aOR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.11-1.34) and relationships in which partners encouraged the participant to use condoms with other partners (aOR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.02-1.28). Relationships in which the partner was married to a woman and/or the partner's HIV status positive or unknown were negatively associated with CCU.,These findings suggest that individuals in relationships where partners were more open and encouraged safer sex were more likely to consistently use condoms. HIV prevention programs should consider leveraging communication to sexual partners to encourage condom use as this may support condom use with other sexual partners. Given sustained and growing HIV and STI epidemics among MSM and TGW, even with pre-exposure prophylaxis scale-up, it is crucial to continue to study optimal implementation strategies to increase condom use.\",\n",

They were asked to rate their concern about their children or themselves having COVID-19.,A total of 662 respondents completed the survey. Parents in the South were significantly more exposed to someone tested positive for COVID-19 than in the North (13.9 and 4.7%, respectively; P < \\xa00.001). Parents in the South were much more concerned than in the North that they (mean 4.61 and 3.32, respectively; P < \\xa00.001) or their child (mean 4.79 and 3.17, respectively; P < \\xa00.001) had COVID-19. Parents reported their children wore facemasks significantly more often in the South than in the North (71.5 and 23.5%, respectively; P < \\xa00.001).,The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant regional differences among families arriving at EDs in Switzerland. Public health agencies should consider regional strategies, rather than country-wide guidelines, in future pandemics and for vaccination against COVID-19 for children.',\n",

This study aims to determine the level of self-perceived food literacy and health promotion literacy among adults with a low and medium level of education and from various subgroups, as well as the association between these food and health literacy levels. Furthermore, this study aims to explore the associations of self-perceived food literacy (SPFL) and health promotion literacy (HPL) in BMI.,A cross-sectional study was conducted among employees with a low and medium level of education. Descriptive analyses were performed to compute SPFL and HPL levels. Analyses of variance were performed to test differences between subgroups. The correlation between SPFL and HPL was computed by Pearson's r. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to explore 1) the association between SPFL and HPL adjusted for demographic characteristics 2) the associations between SPFL and HPL in BMI.,The majority (63.1%) of all participants (n = 222) scored low on SPFL and 34.5% scored inadequate or problematic on HPL. No significant educational or weight-status differences were found in SPFL or HPL levels. On most levels, women compared to men and older compared to younger employees scored significantly higher. A small positive correlation between the two mean levels was found, r = .25, P < .001 (n = 203). Multivariate linear regression analyses showed a significant association between SPFL and HPL (B = .31, 95% CI = .15-.48). No significant associations between SPFL and HPL in BMI were found.,This study suggests there is room for improvement in SPFL and HPL among adults with a low and medium level of education. Future research should consider comparing low and middle socioeconomic with high socioeconomic groups when exploring food and health literacy. Regarding health promotion activities for adults with a low and medium level of education, it is recommended to focus on improving both food and health literacy. Furthermore, more research is needed to explore direct proxies of weight-status to better understand the role of food and health literacy in overweight patterns.\",\n",

Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the classic analysis approach. Transcripts were coded by researchers and analyzed for themes.,Providers (n = 21) reported commonly observed obesogenic practices including overfeeding tendencies, early initiation of solids or less optimal feeding practices, lack of autonomy and self-regulation by child, and suboptimal dietary patterns. Sources of parental misconceptions about feeding were often related to cultural, familial, and media influences, or lack of knowledge about optimal feeding practices for infants or toddlers.,Providers indicated a need for engaging and consistent child feeding and obesity prevention education materials appropriate for diverse cultural and literacy levels of parents, with detailed information on transitioning to solid foods. Early education and community-based providers reported limited access to evidence-based educational materials more so than healthcare providers.

Both have strong empirical support, but few studies have compared their effectiveness head-to-head, and none has investigated what to do if the treatment tried first isn't working well-whether to optimize the treatment already begun or to add the other treatment.,This is a single-blind Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) of 24 weeks duration with two levels of randomization, one in each of two 12-week stages. In Stage 1, children will be randomized to fluoxetine or Coping Cat Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). In Stage 2, remitters will continue maintenance-level therapy with the single-modality treatment received in Stage 1. Non-remitters during the first 12 weeks of treatment will be randomized to either [1] optimization of their Stage 1 treatment, or [2] optimization of Stage 1 treatment and addition of the other intervention. After the 24-week trial, we will follow participants during open, naturalistic treatment to assess the durability of study treatment effects. Patients, 8-17 years of age who are diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, will be recruited and treated within 9 large clinical sites throughout greater Los Angeles. They will be predominantly underserved, ethnic minorities. The primary outcome measure will be the self-report score on the 41-item youth SCARED (Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders). An intent-to-treat analysis will compare youth randomized to fluoxetine first versus those randomized to CBT first (Main Effect 1). Then, among Stage 1 non-remitters, we will compare non-remitters randomized to optimization of their Stage 1 monotherapy versus non-remitters randomized to combination treatment (Main Effect 2).

This network meta-analysis compared the efficacy and safety of ERI versus other chemotherapies in this setting.,Systematic searches conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials identified randomized controlled trials of locally advanced breast cancer/metastatic breast cancer chemotherapies in second- or later-line settings. Efficacy assessment included pre-specified subgroup analysis of breast cancer subtypes. Included studies were assessed for quality using the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination tool. Bayesian network meta-analysis estimated primary outcomes of overall survival and progression-free survival using fixed-effect models. Comparators included: capecitabine (CAP), gemcitabine (GEM), ixabepilone (IXA), utidelone (UTI), treatment by physician's choice (TPC), and vinorelbine (VIN).,The network meta-analysis included seven trials. Results showed that second- or later-line patients treated with ERI had statistically longer overall survival versus TPC (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.81; credible interval [CrI]: 0.66-0.99) or GEM+VIN (0.62; 0.42-0.90) and statistically longer progression-free survival versus TPC (0.76; 0.64-0.90), but statistically shorter progression-free survival versus CAP+IXA (1.40; 1.17-1.67) and CAP+UTI (1.61; 1.23-2.12). In triple negative breast cancer, ERI had statistically longer overall survival versus CAP (0.70; 0.54-0.90); no statistical differences in progression-free survival were observed in triple negative breast cancer.,This network meta-analysis suggests that ERI may provide an overall survival benefit in the overall locally advanced breast cancer/metastatic breast cancer populations and triple negative breast cancer subgroup compared to standard treatments. These findings support the use of ERI in second- or later-line treatment of patients with locally advanced breast cancer/metastatic breast cancer.\",\n",
              " 'Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in females worldwide. Formin-like protein 2 (FMNL2) is a member of formin family that governs cytokinesis, cell polarity, morphogenesis and cell division. To our knowledge, the function of FMNL2 in breast cancer proliferation still remains uncovered.,Tumor immune estimation resource (TIMER) analysis was used to detect the correlation between FMNL2 and Ki67 in breast cancer tissues. Quantitative real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were performed to analyze the expression in human breast cancer cells. Moreover, RNA interference (RNAi) and plasmids were performed to silence and overexpress FMNL2 and p27. The CCK8, MTT, cell counting, colony formation, and 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assays were used to detect cell proliferation, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis was used to detect cell cycle distribution. Further, the distribution of p27 was examined using immunofluorescence.,We found that FMNL2 expression was positively associated with Ki67 among collected breast cancer tissues and in TCGA database. Compared to lower proliferative cells MCF7 and T47D, FMNL2 was overexpressed in highly proliferative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231, BT549 and SUM159, accompanied by reduced levels of p27 and p21, and elevated CyclinD1 and Ki67 expression. FMNL2 silencing significantly inhibited the cell proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells. Meanwhile, FMNL2 overexpression distinctly promoted the cell proliferation of MCF7 cells. Furthermore, FMNL2 suppressed the nuclear levels of p27 and promoted p27 proteasomal degradation in human breast cancer cells. The ubiquitination of p27 was inhibited by FMNL2 silencing in BT549 cells. Besides, p27 silencing markedly elevated Ki67 expression and cell viability, which could be blocked by additionally FMNL2 silencing in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of p27WT significantly reversed the increased levels of FMNL2 and Ki67, cell viability and cell cycle progression induced by FMNL2 overexpression in MCF7 cells. More importantly, compared to p27WT group, those effects could be significantly reversed by p27?NLS overexpression.,These results demonstrated that FMNL2 promoted cell proliferation partially by reducing p27 nuclear localization and p27 protein stability in human breast cancer cells, suggesting the pivotal role of FMNL2 in breast cancer progression.',\n",

With the development of multi-omics measurement techniques in recent years, new methods that integrating multi-omics data into the GSMM show promising effects on the predicted results. It does not only improve the accuracy of phenotype prediction but also enhances the reliability of the model for simulating complex biochemical phenomena, which can promote theoretical breakthroughs for specific gene target identification or better understanding the cell metabolism on the system level.,Based on the basic GSMM model iHL1210 of Aspergillus niger, we integrated large-scale enzyme kinetics and proteomics data to establish a GSMM based on enzyme constraints, termed a GEM with Enzymatic Constraints using Kinetic and Omics data (GECKO). The results show that enzyme constraints effectively improve the model's phenotype prediction ability, and extended the model's potential to guide target gene identification through predicting metabolic phenotype changes of A. niger by simulating gene knockout. In addition, enzyme constraints significantly reduced the solution space of the model, i.e., flux variability over 40.10% metabolic reactions were significantly reduced. The new model showed also versatility in other aspects, like estimating large-scale [Formula: see text] values, predicting the differential expression of enzymes under different growth conditions.,This study shows that incorporating enzymes' abundance information into GSMM is very effective for improving model performance with A. niger. Enzyme-constrained model can be used as a powerful tool for predicting the metabolic phenotype of A. niger by incorporating proteome data. In the foreseeable future, with the fast development of measurement techniques, and more precise and rich proteomics quantitative data being obtained for A. niger, the enzyme-constrained GSMM model will show greater application space on the system level.\",\n",

We framed our initiative by operationalizing the three aspects of PROM collection development: Planning, Selection, and Engagement. Next, we performed a preliminary evaluation of our initiative by assessing the response rate of patients completing PROMs (no. of PROMs completed/no. of PROMs administered) across the entire department (18 clinics), ambulatory clinics only (14 clinics), and hospital-based clinics only (4 clinics). Lastly, we reported on the mean response rates for the top 5 and bottom 5 orthopaedic providers to describe the variability across providers.,We described the development of a fully-integrated, population health based implementation strategy leveraging the existing resources of our local EHR to maximize clinical utility of PROMs and routine collection. We collected a large volume of PROMs over a 13 month period (n = 10,951) across 18 clinical sites, 7 clinical specialties and over 100 providers. The response rates varied across the department, ranging from 29 to 42%, depending on active status for the portal to the electronic health record (MyChart). The highest single provider mean response rate was 52%, and the lowest provider rate was 13%. Rates were similar between hospital-based (26%) and ambulatory clinics (29%).,We found that our standardized PROMs collection initiative, informed by Gensheimer et al., achieved scope and scale, but faced challenges in achieving a high response rate commensurate with existing literature. However, most studies reported a targeted recruitment strategy within a narrow clinical population. Further research is needed to elucidate the trade-off between scalability and response rates in PROM collection initiatives.\",\n",

Overall HEV RNA was detected in 53/388 (13.7, 95% CI: 10.40-17.48%) pig rectal swabs in five production stages (age categories) with statistically significant differences among all the stages. The highest HEV prevalence was observed in weaners 24/81 (29.6, 95% CI: 19.99-40.81%) and then significantly declined in growers and fatteners. No HEV was detected in suckling piglets and sows. Twenty-eight partial sequences of ORF1 (242 bp) and seventeen of ORF2 (304 bp) were analysed. Phylogenetic analysis and p-distance comparisons confirmed in both ORFs that all Slovak HEV sequences belong to the genotype HEV-3, major clade 3abchij with higher identity to 3a and 3i subtypes. Three sequences were outside of all lastly updated HEV-3 subtypes.,This is the first report to fill the information gap about HEV infection in pigs in Slovakia.

As a major drainage vessel, covering the whole extension of the sagittal fissure, the SSS impedes direct bilateral access to underlying regions for recording and stimulation probes, drug-delivery cannulas, and injection devices. We now describe a new method for transection and retraction of the SSS in rats, that allows the accurate placement of microinjection devices, or chronic electrode probes, while avoiding hemorrhage and the ensuing deleterious consequences for local structures, animal health, and behavior. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach we evaluated its consequences acutely during surgery, and thereafter during surgical survival, recovery, behavioral testing, as well as postmortem analysis of histologic impact in the related brain structures of male rats. This method provides a new approach enabling direct access for manipulation and recording of activity in brain areas previously obstructed by the SSS.',\n",

No objective data on the impact of the pandemic on the management of surgical waiting lists is available. We conducted a survey in colorectal surgery units to assess the impact on colorectal cancer surgery waiting lists.,All personnel in charge of colorectal surgery units nationwide received a survey (from February to April, 2020) with eight questions divided into three sections-cessation date of colorectal cancer surgeries, number of patients waiting for treatment, and use of neoadjuvant therapy to postpone surgery.,Sixty-seven units participated in the study, with 79.1% of units ceasing some type of activity (32.8% total and 46.3% partial cessation) and 20.9% continuing all surgical activity. In addition, 65% of units used or prolonged neoadjuvant therapy in rectal cancer patients and 40% of units performed at least five emergency colorectal cancer surgeries. It was estimated that at least one month of intense surgical activity will be required to catch up.,Currently, patients from units with a long waiting list must be redistributed, at least within the country. In the future, in the event of a second wave of the pandemic, an effective program to manage each unit's resources should be developed to prevent total collapse.\",\n",
              " 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection continues to be a serious global public health threat. The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is a virus protease encoded by SARS-CoV-2, which is essential for virus replication. We have previously reported a series of small-molecule 3CLpro inhibitors effective for inhibiting replication of human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture and in animal models. Here we generated a series of deuterated variants of a 3CLpro inhibitor, GC376, and evaluated the antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. The deuterated GC376 displayed potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 in the enzyme- and the cell-based assays. The K18-hACE2 mice develop mild to lethal infection commensurate with SARS-CoV-2 challenge doses and were proposed as a model for efficacy testing of antiviral agents. We treated lethally infected mice with a deuterated derivative of GC376. Treatment of K18-hACE2 mice at 24 h postinfection with a derivative (compound 2) resulted in increased survival of mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. Lung virus titers were decreased, and histopathological changes were ameliorated in compound 2-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. Structural investigation using high-resolution crystallography illuminated binding interactions of 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with deuterated variants of GC376. Taken together, deuterated GC376 variants have excellent potential as antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

Cells linking visual processing to person memory have been proposed but not found. Here, we report the discovery of such cells through recordings from an area in the macaque temporal pole identified with functional magnetic resonance imaging. These cells responded to faces that were personally familiar. They responded nonlinearly to stepwise changes in face visibility and detail and holistically to face parts, reflecting key signatures of familiar face recognition. They discriminated between familiar identities, as fast as a general face identity area. The discovery of these cells establishes a new pathway for the fast recognition of familiar individuals.',\n",

Barnason's oral assessment guide was used to evaluate the oral health of both groups before oral care during the first 24 hr of tracheal intubation (Day 0) and at Day 2 and Day 3. Oropharyngeal secretion, endotracheal tube aspirate, and nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage samples were collected on Day 0 and Day 3.,The rate of VAT development was not statistically different between the groups (p = .318). However, a significant difference existed in the rate of VAP development (p = .043). The frequency of oropharyngeal colonization significantly decreased in the 0.12% CHX group compared with the placebo group at Day 3 (p = .001).,The use of 0.12% CHX for oral care could be effective for VAP prevention and reducing microbial colonization in mechanically ventilated patients.\",\n",

Ongoing data validation, concurrent monitoring, and analysis on incidence of venous thrombolytic events identified barriers to evidence-based chemoprophylaxis administration.,There were a total of 4,711 trauma patients in the analysis. Compared with preintervention (fall 2017), the fall 2019 TQIP report indicated the pulmonary embolus odds ratio dropped to 0.56, lowering the benchmark decile from 10 (worst) to 1 (best). The proportion of patients receiving no chemoprophylaxis decreased to 23% and was lower than all hospitals (32%). The rate of low-molecular-weight heparin use increased to 80% for patients receiving chemoprophylaxis, and unfractionated heparin use plummeted to 14%. The proportion of patients with no chemoprophylaxis in the severe traumatic brain injury cohort fell to 21%.,The high pulmonary embolus rate was driven by inaccurate data, infrequent monitoring, suboptimal ordering, and administration of chemoprophylaxis.

              " \"Characterizing a protein's higher-order structure is essential for understanding its function. Mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a powerful tool for this purpose, especially for protein systems that are difficult to study by traditional methods. To study a protein's structure by MS, specific chemical reactions are performed in solution that encode a protein's structural information into its mass. One particularly effective approach is to use reagents that covalently modify solvent accessible amino acid side chains. These reactions lead to mass increases that can be localized with residue-level resolution when combined with proteolytic digestion and tandem mass spectrometry. Here, we describe the protocols associated with use of diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) as a covalent labeling reagent together with MS detection. DEPC is a highly electrophilic molecule capable of labeling up to 30% of the residues in the average protein, thereby providing excellent structural resolution. DEPC has been successfully used together with MS to obtain structural information for small single-domain proteins, such as ß2-microglobulin, to large multi-domain proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies.\",\n",
              " 'Despite advances in treatment over the last decades, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) continues to carry a high burden of morbidity and mortality, largely afflicting a fairly young population. Several animal models of SAH have been developed to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms behind SAH and to test pharmacological interventions. The pre-chiasmatic, single injection model in the rat presented in this article is an experimental model of SAH with a predetermined blood volume. Briefly, the animal is anesthetized, intubated, and kept under mechanical ventilation. Temperature is regulated with a heating pad. A catheter is placed in the tail artery, enabling continuous blood pressure measurement as well as blood sampling. The atlantooccipital membrane is incised and a catheter for pressure recording is placed in the cisterna magna to enable intracerebral pressure measurement. This catheter can also be used for intrathecal therapeutic interventions. The rat is placed in a stereotaxic frame, a burr hole is drilled anteriorly to the bregma, and a catheter is inserted through the burr hole and placed just anterior to the optic chiasm. Autologous blood (0.3 mL) is withdrawn from the tail catheter and manually injected. This results in a rise of intracerebral pressure and a decrease of cerebral blood flow. The animal is kept sedated for 30 min and given subcutaneous saline and analgesics. The animal is extubated and returned to its cage. The pre-chiasmatic model has a high reproducibility rate and limited variation between animals due to the pre-determined blood volume. It mimics SAH in humans making it a relevant model for SAH research.',\n",

All participants were asked to hit the ball into the target zone by cross-step and chasse step, respectively. The ground reaction force in the anterior-posterior, medial-lateral, and vertical directions of the participant was measured by a force platform. The key finding of this study was that: the posterior ground reaction force of cross-step footwork (0.89 ± 0.21) was significantly large (P = 0.014) than the chasse step footwork (0.82 ± 0.18). However, the lateral ground reaction force of cross-step footwork (-0.38 ± 0.21) was significantly lower (P < 0.001) than chasse step footwork (-0.46 ± 0.29) as well as the vertical ground reaction force of cross-step footwork (1.73 ± 0.19) was significantly lower (P < 0.001) than chasse step footwork (1.9 ± 0.33). Based on the mechanism of the kinetic chain, the better lower limb dynamic performance of sliding stroke may be conducive to energy transmission and thus bring gain to the swing speed. Beginners should start from the chasse step to hit the ball technically, and then practice the skill of cross-step.',\n",
              " \"Events associated with oocyte nuclear maturation have been well described. However, much less is known about the molecular pathways and processes that take place in the cytoplasm in preparation for fertilization and acquisition of totipotency. During oocyte maturation, changes in gene expression depend exclusively on the translation and degradation of maternal messenger RNAs (mRNAs) rather than on transcription. Execution of the translational program, therefore, plays a key role in establishing oocyte developmental competence to sustain embryo development. This paper is part of a focus on defining the program of maternal mRNA translation that takes place during meiotic maturation and at the oocyte-to-zygote transition. In this method paper, a strategy is presented to study the regulation of translation of target mRNAs during in vitro oocyte maturation. Here, a Ypet reporter is fused to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the gene of interest and then micro-injected into oocytes together with polyadenylated mRNA encoding for mCherry to control for injected volume. By using time-lapse microscopy to measure reporter accumulation, translation rates are calculated at different transitions during oocyte meiotic maturation. Here, the protocols for oocyte isolation and injection, time-lapse recording, and data analysis have been described, using the Ypet/interleukin-7 (IL-7)-3' UTR reporter as an example.\",\n",
              " 'Reflectance Spectroscopy (RS) and Fiber Optics Reflectance Spectroscopy (FORS) are well-established techniques for the investigation of works of art with particular attention to paintings. Most modern museums put at the disposal of their research groups portable equipment that, together with the intrinsic non-invasiveness of RS and FORS, makes possible the in situ collection of reflectance spectra from the surface of artefacts. The comparison, performed by experts in pigments and painting materials, of the experimental data with databases of reference spectra drives the characterization of the palettes and of the techniques used by the artists. However, this approach requires specific skills and it is time consuming especially if the number of the spectra to be investigated becomes large as is the case of Hyperspectral Reflectance Imaging (HRI) datasets. The HRI experimental setups are multi-dimensional cameras that associate the spectral information, given by the reflectance spectra, with the spatial localization of the spectra over the painted surface. The resulting datasets are 3D-cubes (called hypercubes or data-cubes) where the first two dimensions locate the spectrum over the painting and the third is the spectrum itself (i.e., the reflectance of that point of the painted surface versus the wavelength in the operative range of the detector). The capability of the detector to simultaneously collect a great number of spectra (typically much more than 10,000 for each hypercube) makes the HRI datasets large reservoirs of information and justifies the need for the development of robust and, possibly, automated protocols to analyze the data. After the description of the procedure designed for the data acquisition, we present an analysis method that systematically exploits the potential of the hypercubes. Based on Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and on the manipulation of the collected spectra, the algorithm handles and analyzes thousands of spectra while at the same time it supports\\xa0the user to unveil the features of the samples under investigation. The power of the approach is illustrated by applying it to Quarto Stato, the iconic masterpiece by Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo, held in the Museo del Novecento in Milan (Italy).',\n",
              " \"The leading cause of death worldwide persists as cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, modeling the physiological and biological complexity of the heart muscle, the myocardium, is notoriously difficult to accomplish in vitro. Mainly, obstacles lie in the need for human cardiomyocytes (CMs) that are either adult or exhibit adult-like phenotypes and can successfully replicate the myocardium's cellular complexity and intricate 3D architecture. Unfortunately, due to ethical concerns and lack of available primary patient-derived human cardiac tissue, combined with the minimal proliferation of CMs, the sourcing of viable human CMs has been a limiting step for cardiac tissue engineering. To this end, most research has transitioned toward cardiac differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) as the primary source of human CMs, resulting in the wide incorporation of hiPSC-CMs within in vitro assays for cardiac tissue modeling. Here in this work, we demonstrate a protocol for developing a 3D mature stem cell-derived human cardiac tissue within a microfluidic device. We specifically explain and visually demonstrate the production of a 3D in vitro anisotropic cardiac tissue-on-a-chip model from hiPSC-derived CMs. We primarily describe a purification protocol to select for CMs, the co-culture of cells with a defined ratio via mixing CMs with human CFs (hCFs), and suspension of this co-culture within the collagen-based hydrogel. We further demonstrate the injection of the cell-laden hydrogel within our well-defined microfluidic device, embedded with staggered elliptical microposts that serve as surface topography to induce a high degree of alignment of the surrounding cells and the hydrogel matrix, mimicking the architecture of the native myocardium. We envision that the proposed 3D anisotropic cardiac tissue-on-chip model is suitable for fundamental biology studies, disease modeling, and, through its use as a screening tool, pharmaceutical testing.\",\n",
              " 'Reversible oxidative modifications on protein thiols have recently emerged as important mediators of cellular function. Herein we describe the detailed procedure of a quantitative redox proteomics method that utilizes resin-assisted capture (RAC) in combination with tandem mass tag (TMT) isobaric labeling and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to allow multiplexed stochiometric quantification of oxidized protein thiols at the proteome level. The site-specific quantitative information on oxidized cysteine residues provides additional insight into the functional impacts of such modifications. The workflow is adaptable across many sample types, including cultured cells (e.g., mammalian, prokaryotic) and whole tissues (e.g., heart, lung, muscle), which are initially lysed/homogenized and with free thiols being alkylated to prevent artificial oxidation. The oxidized protein thiols are then reduced and captured by a thiol-affinity resin, which streamlines and simplifies the workflow steps by allowing the proceeding digestion, labeling, and washing procedures to be performed without additional transfer of proteins/peptides. Finally, the labeled peptides are eluted and analyzed by LC-MS/MS to reveal comprehensive stoichiometric changes related to thiol oxidation across the entire proteome. This method greatly improves the understanding of the role of redox-dependent regulation under physiological and pathophysiological states related to protein thiol oxidation.',\n",

These diseases cause neurodevelopmental defects whose underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. A major roadblock is the lack of effective models recapitulating the early-onset neuronal impairment seen in the patients. Advances in the technology of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) enable the generation of three-dimensional (3D) brain organoids that can be used to investigate the impact of diseases on the development and organization of the nervous system. Researchers, including these authors, have recently introduced human brain organoids to model mitochondrial disorders. This paper reports a detailed protocol for the robust generation of human iPSC-derived brain organoids and their use in mitochondrial bioenergetic profiling and imaging analyses. These experiments will allow the use of brain organoids to investigate metabolic and developmental dysfunctions and may provide crucial information to dissect the neuronal pathology of mitochondrial diseases.',\n",
              " 'Operators of hand tractors are exposed to high levels of hand transmitted vibration (HTV). This vibration, which can be both irksome and hazardous to human health, is imparted to the operator via his or her hands and arms. However, a standardized method for measuring HTV of hand tractors has yet to be defined. The aim of the study was to present an experimental method for the investigation of the biodynamic response and vibration transmissibility of the hand-arm system during the operation of a hand tractor in a stationary mode. Measurements were performed with ten subjects using three grip forces and three handle vibration levels to examine the influences of the hand pressure and frequency on hand transmitted vibration (HTV). The results indicate that the tightness of grip on the handle influences the vibration response of the hand-arm system, especially at frequencies between 20 and 100 Hz. The transmission of lower frequencies in the hand-arm system was relatively unattenuated. In comparison, attenuation was found to be quite marked for higher frequencies during the operation of the hand tractor. The vibration transmissibility to different parts of the hand-arm system decreased with the increase of the distance from the vibration source. The proposed methodology contributes to the collection of consistent data for the evaluation of operator vibration exposure and the ergonomics development of hand tractors.',\n",
              " 'Zebrafish larval xenografts are being widely used for cancer research to perform in vivo and real-time studies of human cancer. The possibility of rapidly visualizing the response to anti-cancer therapies (chemo, radiotherapy, and biologicals), angiogenesis and metastasis with single cell resolution, places the zebrafish xenograft model as a top choice to develop preclinical studies. The zebrafish larval xenograft assay presents several experimental advantages compared to other models, but probably the most striking is the reduction of size scale and consequently time. This reduction of scale allows single cell imaging, the use of a relatively low number of human cells (compatible with biopsies), medium-high-throughput drug screenings, but most importantly enables a significant reduction of the time of the assay. All these advantages make the zebrafish xenograft assay extremely attractive for future personalized medicine applications. Many zebrafish xenograft protocols have been developed with a wide diversity of human tumors; however, a general and standardized protocol to efficiently generate zebrafish larval xenografts is still lacking. Here we provide a step-by-step protocol, with tips to generate xenografts and guidelines for tumor behavior analysis, whole-mount immunofluorescence, and confocal imaging quantification.',\n",
              " 'Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been extensively investigated for decades for tumor treatment because of its non-invasiveness, spatiotemporal selectivity, lower side-effects, and immune activation ability. It can be a promising treatment modality in several medical fields, including oncology, immunology, urology, dermatology, ophthalmology, cardiology, pneumology, and dentistry. Nevertheless, the clinical application of PDT is largely restricted by the drawbacks of traditional photosensitizers, limited tissue penetrability of light, inefficient induction of tumor cell death, tumor resistance to the therapy, and the severe pain induced by the therapy. Recently, various photosensitizer formulations and therapy strategies have been developed to overcome these barriers. Significantly, the introduction of nanomaterials in PDT, as carriers or photosensitizers, may overcome the drawbacks of traditional photosensitizers. Based on this, nanocomposites excited by various light sources are applied in the PDT of deep-seated tumors. Modulation of cell death pathways with co-delivered reagents promotes PDT induced tumor cell death. Relief of tumor resistance to PDT with combined therapy strategies further promotes tumor inhibition. Also, the optimization of photosensitizer formulations and therapy procedures reduces pain in PDT. Here, a systematic summary of recent advances in the fabrication of photosensitizers and the design of therapy strategies to overcome barriers in PDT is presented. Several aspects important for the clinical application of PDT in cancer treatment are also discussed.',\n",

The perceived physical and mental health status resulted better for men than for women. The integrated analysis of gender differences in socio-demographic and behavioral lifestyles and determinants of health revealed important inequalities, mainly related to citizenship and educational level, among the socio-demographic factors, and smoking habit and obesity, among the behavioral lifestyle factors.,Gender imbalances mainly fall into inequality in social inclusion, educational level, and healthy lifestyle.

Despite this importance, relatively few amino acid transporter genes have been characterized and their role elucidated with certainty. Two main families of proteins encode amino acid transporters in plants: the amino acid-polyamine-organocation superfamily, containing mostly importers, and the UMAMIT (usually multiple acids move in and out transporter) family, apparently encoding exporters, totaling 63 and 44 genes in Arabidopsis, respectively. Knowledge of UMAMITs is scarce, based on six Arabidopsis genes and a handful of genes from other species. To gain insight into the role of the members of this family and provide data to be used for future characterization, we studied the evolution of the UMAMITs in plants, and determined the functional properties, the structure, and localization of the 47 Arabidopsis UMAMITs. Our analysis showed that the AtUMAMITs are essentially localized at the tonoplast or the plasma membrane, and that most of them are able to export amino acids from the cytosol, confirming a role in intra- and intercellular amino acid transport. As an example, this set of data was used to hypothesize the role of a few AtUMAMITs in the plant and the cell.',\n",

Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is an example of a low resolution, functional imaging modality that typically has very low resolution due to the ill-posedness of its underlying inverse problem. Combining the functional information of DOT with a high resolution structural imaging modality has been studied widely. In particular, the combination of DOT with ultrasound (US) could serve as a useful tool for clinicians for the formulation of accurate diagnosis of breast lesions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for US-guided DOT reconstruction using a portable time-domain measurement system. B-mode US imaging is used to retrieve morphological information on the probed tissues by means of a semi-automatical segmentation procedure based on active contour fitting. A two-dimensional to three-dimensional extrapolation procedure, based on the concept of distance transform, is then applied to generate a three-dimensional edge-weighting prior for the regularization of DOT. The reconstruction procedure has been tested on experimental data obtained on specifically designed dual-modality silicon phantoms. Results show a substantial quantification improvement upon the application of the implemented technique.

              " 'The development of cancer resistance continues to represent a bottleneck of cancer therapy. It is one of the leading factors preventing drugs to exhibit their full therapeutic potential. Consequently, it reduces the efficacy of anticancer therapy and causes the survival rate of therapy-resistant patients to be far from satisfactory. Here, an emerging strategy for overcoming drug resistance is proposed employing a novel two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterial polysiloxane (PSX). We have reported on the synthesis of PSX nanosheets (PSX NSs) and proved that they have favorable properties for biomedical applications. PSX NSs evinced unprecedented cytocompatibility up to the concentration of 300 µg/mL, while inducing very low level of red blood cell hemolysis and were found to be highly effective for anticancer drug binding. PSX NSs enhanced the efficacy of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) by around 27.8-43.4% on average and, interestingly, were found to be especially effective in the therapy of drug-resistant tumors, improving the effectiveness of up to 52%. Fluorescence microscopy revealed improved retention of DOX within the drug-resistant cells when bound on PSX NSs. DOX bound on the surface of PSX NSs, i.e., PSX@DOX, improved, in general, the DOX cytotoxicity in vitro. More importantly, PSX@DOX reduced the growth of DOX-resistant tumors in vivo with 3.5 times better average efficiency than the free drug. Altogether, this paper represents an introduction of a new 2D nanomaterial derived from silicane and pioneers its biomedical application. As advances in the field of material synthesis are rapidly progressing, novel 2D nanomaterials with improved properties are being synthesized and await thorough exploration. Our findings further provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the cancer resistance and can promote the development of a precise cancer therapy.',\n",

The effect of microbial activity on the taste, bioavailability and preservation of the nutrients and the different food matrices has been deciphered by the insights of molecular microbiology. Among those roles of fermentation in the food chain, biopreservation remains the one most debated. Presumably because it has been underestimated for quite a while, and only considered - based on a food safety and technological approach - from the toxicological and chemical perspective. Biopreservation is not considered as a traditional use, where it has been by design - but forgotten - as the initial goal of fermentation. The 'modern' use of biopreservation is also slightly different from the traditional use, due mainly to changes in cooling of food and other ways of preservation, Extending shelf life is considered to be one of the properties of food additives, classifying - from our perspective - biopreservation wrongly and forgetting the role of fermentation and food cultures. The present review will summarize the current approaches of fermentation as a way to preserve and protect the food, considering the different way in which food cultures and this application could help tackle food waste as an additional control measure to ensure the safety of the food.\",\n",

Here, we identify a 13C signal (i.e. systematic 13C/12C variation) at tree-ring glucose C-4 and report an experimentally testable theory on its origin. We propose the signal is introduced by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases in the cytosol of leaves. It conveys two kinds of (potentially convoluted) information: (i) commitment of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 3-phosphoglycerate versus fructose 1,6-bisphosphate metabolism; and (ii) the contribution of non-phosphorylating versus phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to catalysing the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 3-phosphoglycerate forward reaction of glycolysis. The theory is supported by 13C fractionation modelling. Modelling results provide the first evidence in support of the cytosolic oxidation-reduction (COR) cycle, a carbon-neutral mechanism supplying NADPH at the expense of ATP and NADH, which may help to maintain leaf-cytosolic redox balances. In line with expectations related to COR cycling, we found a positive correlation between air vapour pressure deficit and 13C discrimination at glucose C-4. Overall, 13C-4 signal analysis may enable an improved understanding of leaf carbon and energy metabolism.',\n",

              " 'In vitro molecular circuits, based on DNA-programmable chemistries, can perform an increasing range of high-level functions, such as molecular level computation, image or chemical pattern recognition and pattern generation. Most reported demonstrations, however, can only accept nucleic acids as input signals. Real-world applications of these programmable chemistries critically depend on strategies to interface them with a variety of non-DNA inputs, in particular small biologically relevant chemicals. We introduce here a general strategy to interface DNA-based circuits with non-DNA signals, based on input-translating modules. These translating modules contain a DNA response part and an allosteric protein sensing part, and use a simple design that renders them fully tunable and modular. They can be repurposed to either transmit or invert the response associated with the presence of a given input. By combining these translating-modules with robust and leak-free amplification motifs, we build sensing circuits that provide a fluorescent quantitative time-response to the concentration of their small-molecule input, with good specificity and sensitivity. The programmability of the DNA layer can be leveraged to perform DNA based signal processing operations, which we demonstrate here with logical inversion, signal modulation and a classification task on two inputs. The DNA circuits are also compatible with standard biochemical conditions, and we show the one-pot detection of an enzyme through its native metabolic activity. We anticipate that this sensitive small-molecule-to-DNA conversion strategy will play a critical role in the future applications of molecular-level circuitry.',\n",

Although many ribosome structures were solved in recent years, a high-resolution structure of a two-domain mRNA-binding competent rS1 construct is not yet available. Here, we present the NMR solution structure of the minimal mRNA-binding fragment of Vibrio Vulnificus rS1 containing the domains D3 and D4. Both domains are homologues and adapt an oligonucleotide-binding fold (OB fold) motif. NMR titration experiments reveal that recognition of miscellaneous mRNAs occurs via a continuous interaction surface to one side of these structurally linked domains. Using a novel paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) approach and exploring different spin-labeling positions within RNA, we were able to track the location and determine the orientation of the RNA in the rS1-D34 bound form. Our investigations show that paramagnetically labeled RNAs, spiked into unmodified RNA, can be used as a molecular ruler to provide structural information on protein-RNA complexes. The dynamic interaction occurs on a defined binding groove spanning both domains with identical ß2-ß3-ß5 interfaces. Evidently, the 3'-ends of the cis-acting RNAs are positioned in the direction of the N-terminus of the rS1 protein, thus towards the 30S binding site and adopt a conformation required for translation initiation.\",\n",

Here we show that recombinant LSH interacts in vitro with macroH2A1-H2B and macroH2A2-H2B dimers, but not with H2A.Z-H2B dimers. Moreover, LSH catalyzes the transfer of macroH2A into mono-nucleosomes reconstituted with canonical core histones in an ATP dependent manner. LSH requires the ATP binding site and the replacement process is unidirectional leading to heterotypic and homotypic nucleosomes. Both variants macroH2A1 and macroH2A2 are equally well incorporated into the nucleosome.

The matching of the controls was performed according to age (±1 year) and number of oocytes retrieved (±10%). The main outcome was CLBR defined as a live-born delivery after 24 weeks of gestation.,The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. Estradiol levels on the day of trigger were significantly higher in the elevated P group. There was no significant difference in terms of fertilisation rate between the two groups. The elevated P group had significantly more cleavage stage frozen embryos compared to the normal P group while the total number of cryopreserved blastocyst stage embryos was the same. The CLBR did not differ between the two study groups (29.3% and 28.2% in the normal versus LFEP respectively, P = 0.773), also following confounder adjustment using multivariable GEE regression analysis (accounting for age at oocyte retrieval, total dose of FSH, progesterone levels on the day of ovulation trigger, day of freezing, at least one top-quality embryo transferred and number of previous IVF cycles, as the independent variables).,This is a multicentre observational study based on a retrospective data analysis. Better extrapolation of the results could be validated by performing a prospective analysis.,This is the first study demonstrating that LFEP in the fresh cycle does not hinder CLBR of the subsequent frozen cycles in a FA approach. Thus, a FA strategy circumvents the issue of elevated P in the late follicular phase.,No funding was received for this study.

              " 'There has been a substantial increase in the incidence and the prevalence of allergic disorders in the recent decades, which seems to be related to rapid environmental and lifestyle changes, such as higher exposure to factors thought to exert pro-allergic effects but less contact with factors known to be associated with protection against the development of allergies. Pollution is the most remarkable example of the former, while less contact with microorganisms, lower proportion of unprocessed natural products in diet, and others resulting from urbanization and westernization of the lifestyle exemplify the latter. It is strongly believed that the effects of environmental factors on allergy susceptibility and development are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, i.e. biologically relevant biochemical changes of the chromatin carrying transcriptionally-relevant information but not affecting the nucleotide sequence of the genome. Classical epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation and histone modifications, for instance acetylation or methylation. In addition, microRNA controls gene expression at the mRNA level. Such epigenetic mechanisms are involved in crucial regulatory processes in cells playing a pivotal role in allergies. Those include centrally managing cells, such as T lymphocytes, as well as specific structural and effector cells in the affected organs, responsible for the local clinical presentation of allergy, e.g. epithelial or airway smooth muscle cells in asthma. Considering that allergic disorders possess multiple clinical (phenotypes) and mechanistic (endotypes) forms, targeted, stratified treatment strategies based on detailed clinical and molecular diagnostics are required. Since conventional diagnostic or therapeutic approaches do not suffice, this gap could possibly be filled out by epigenetic approaches.',\n",

              " 'Palladium nanoparticles (Pd-NPs) have been approved as an effective catalyst for hydrogen peroxide decomposition which is released during specific enzymatic reactions. However, the general operational principles and electrochemical performance of Pd-NPs-based nanobiosensors have been poorly exploited. Here, the electrochemical behavior of oxidase-associated peroxide oxidation co-catalysis of the modelled microanalytical system based on screen-printed electrodes modified by electroplated Pd-NPs as an electrocatalyst, glucose oxidase (GOx) or alcohol oxidase (AOx) as a bioreceptor and the ionomer Nafion as a polymeric binding agent was studied in detail. The impact of palladium surface oxides and adsorbed oxygen on the activity and product selectivity in an oxidase type of nanobiosensor was ascertained. To avoid PdO and oxygen electroreduction affecting the entire amperometric response of Pd-NPs-based nanobiosensors, a special two-step polarization procedure was proposed. Under the established electrochemical conditions, Pd-NPs-based nanobiosensors with encapsulated oxidases showed a wide dynamic range towards selective bioanalyte detection, excellent basic line stability, accuracy and resistance to the presence of interfering electrochemical species. This work can serve as a guideline for the search and validation of operational principles of novel biosensors based on nanoparticles.',\n",

              " 'Polyampholyte hydrogels are attractive materials for tissue engineering scaffolds as they offer a wide variety of features including nonfouling, selective protein delivery, and tunable physical characteristics. However, to improve the potential performance of these materials for in vivo applications, there is a need for a higher diversity of zwitterionic cross-linker species to replace commonly used ethylene glycol (EG) based chemistries. Towards this end, the synthesis of a dipeptide based zwitterionic cross-linker, N-Ser-Ser-C dimethacrylate (S-S) from N-Boc-l-serine is presented. The strategy utilized a convergent coupling of methacrylated serine partners followed by careful global deprotection to yield the zwitterionic cross-linker with good overall yields. This novel cross-linker was incorporated into a polyampholyte hydrogel and its physical properties and biocompatibility were compared against a polyampholyte hydrogel synthesized with an EG-based cross-linker. The S-S cross-linked hydrogel demonstrated excellent nonfouling performance, while promoting enhanced cellular adhesion to fibrinogen delivered from the hydrogel. Therefore, the results suggest that the S-S cross-linker will demonstrate superior future performance for in vivo applications.',\n",
              " 'In addition to terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), mobile laser scanning (MLS) is increasingly arousing interest as a technique which provides valuable 3-D data for various applications in forest research. Using mobile platforms, the 3-D recording of large forest areas is carried out within a short space of time. Vegetation structure is described by millions of 3-D points which show an accuracy in the millimetre range and offer a powerful basis for automated vegetation modelling. The successful extraction of single trees from the point cloud is essential for further evaluations and modelling at the individual-tree level, such as volume determination, quantitative structure modelling or local neighbourhood analyses. However, high-precision automated tree segmentation is challenging, and has so far mostly been performed using elaborate interactive segmentation methods.,Here, we present a novel segmentation algorithm to automatically segment trees in MLS point clouds, applying distance adaptivity as a function of trajectory. In addition, tree parameters are determined simultaneously. In our validation study, we used a total of 825 trees from ten sample plots to compare the data of trees segmented from MLS data with manual inventory parameters and parameters derived from semi-automatic TLS segmentation.,The tree detection rate reached 96 % on average for trees with distances up to 45 m from the trajectory. Trees were almost completely segmented up to a distance of about 30 m from the MLS trajectory. The accuracy of tree parameters was similar for MLS-segmented and TLS-segmented trees.,Besides plot characteristics, the detection rate of trees in MLS data strongly depends on the distance to the travelled track. The algorithm presented here facilitates the acquisition of important tree parameters from MLS data, as an area-wide automated derivation can be accomplished in a very short time.',\n",
              " 'Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) is a trivalent adaptor protein and a key element in signal transduction. It interacts via its flanking nSH3 and cSH3 domains with the proline-rich domain (PRD) of the RAS activator SOS1 and via its central SH2 domain with phosphorylated tyrosine residues of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs; e.g. HER2). The elucidation of structural organization and mechanistic insights into GRB2 interactions, however, remain challenging due to their inherent ?exibility. This study represents an important advance in our mechanistic understanding of how GRB2 links RTKs to SOS1. Accordingly, it can be proposed that (1) HER2 pYP-bound SH2 potentiates GRB2 SH3 domain interactions with SOS1 (an allosteric mechanism); (2) the SH2 domain blocks cSH3, enabling nSH3 to bind SOS1 first before cSH3 follows (an avidity-based mechanism); and (3) the allosteric behavior of cSH3 to other domains appears to be unidirectional, although there is an allosteric effect between the SH2 and SH3 domains.',\n",
              " \"During the coronavirus pandemic, second-year students on the B.Sc. molecular biology and genetics degree at Istanbul Technical University sat an open-ended online exam for a microbiology course in which one of the compulsory questions asked how the course had helped them during the first phase of the pandemic (April-July 2020). Fifty of 69 students gave consent for their (anonymous) responses to be analysed in order to discern any key ways in which their knowledge had been applied. The aim of the study was to investigate whether taking an advanced microbiology course increases understanding of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and has a positive impact on student behaviours with respect to public health practices. Findings were divided into four major themes: course content (information), application of course content to behavioural change (practice), professionalism and their 'audience' whilst at home in lockdown (family and friends). Social distancing, wearing face masks, and hand and surface hygiene were described as important behaviours, with this practice informed by their basic microbiology knowledge. This paper describes a scenario where rote assessment can be used to assess wider scientific literacy with respect to application in society, providing students with an opportunity to incorporate and apply their learning into real-life situations, whilst tutors can assess constructivist learning, conceptual understanding and impact on student behaviour.\",\n",
              " 'Mesophyll conductance (gm) is an important factor limiting photosynthesis. However, gm response to long-term growth in variable [CO2] is not well understood, particularly in crop plants. Here, we grew two cultivars of wheat (Halberd and Cranbrook), known to differ in gm under current environmental conditions, in four [CO2] treatments: glacial (206 µmol mol-1), pre-industrial (344 µmol mol-1), current ambient (489 µmol mol-1), and super-elevated (1085 µmol mol-1), and two water treatments (well-watered and moderate water limitation), to develop an evolutionary and future climate perspective on gm control of photosynthesis and water-use efficiency (WUE). In the two wheat genotypes, gm increased with rising [CO2] from glacial to ambient [CO2], but declined at super-elevated [CO2]. The responses of gm to different growth [CO2] also depend on water stress; however, the specific mechanism of gm response to [CO2] remains unclear. Although gm and gm/gsc (mesophyll conductance/stomatal conductance) were strongly associated with the variability of photosynthetic rates (A) and WUE, we found that plants with higher gm may increase A without increasing gsc, which increased WUE. These results may be useful to inform plant breeding programmes and cultivar selection for Australian wheat under future environmental conditions.',\n",
              " 'Agglutinin-like sequence protein 3 (Als3) is a cell surface glycoprotein of Candida albicans that plays essential roles in the processes of adherence and biofilm formation in vitro. In this study, we focused on the contribution of Als3 to the structure and drug susceptibility of biofilms. The C. albicans wild-type (WT) strain DAY185, the als3?/? null strain and the als3?/? + pALS3 complemented strain were used. Colony-forming unit enumeration, crystal violet and cell surface hydrophobicity assays, scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy coupled with analyses using COMSTAT software were performed to evaluate the biomass and architecture of the biofilms. The detailed architectural analysis showed a significant variation in the biofilm parameters of the als3?/? biofilms compared with those of the WT biofilms. Fluconazole, miconazole and amphotericin B were selected as the antifungal agents for the antimycotic susceptibility test, and increased susceptibility was found with the ALS3 deletion biofilms. A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed downregulation of biofilm formation-related genes (ALS1, EFG1, HWP1 and CSH1) and drug resistance-related genes (ERG11, CDR1, CDR2 and MDR1) in the als3?/? biofilms. We concluded that Als3 contributes to biofilm formation by changing the biofilm architecture and is involved in the antifungal resistance of C. albicans biofilms.',\n",

Quality of life was measured as life satisfaction with the World Health Organization Quality of life assessment (WHOQoL-5) and mental health was measured using the Mental Health subscale (MHI-5).,Overall, sociodemographic characteristics were more prominently associated with quality of life and participation than were spinal cord injury characteristics. Currently working as main activity and having a family income in the highest quartile were associated with higher scores on all 4 measures of participation and quality of life. There was a strong gradient between higher level of participation (frequency and restrictions) and better quality of life.,Participation was strongly associated with life satisfaction and mental health in people living with spinal cord injury. This indicates that participation issues should be given greater priority during post-acute rehabilitation, follow-up and subsequent care efforts provided in the community.',\n",

Previous studies have established the presence of anabolic activity of dry extracts of Iris hungarica leaves and rhizomes in intact animals. Therefore, it was reasonable to study the effect of the experimental extracts on the state of protein metabolism, which is regulated by glucocorticoids. The model of hydrocortisoneinduced protein catabolism was used to determine anabolic activity for dry extracts of Iris hungarica leaves and rhizomes at a\\xa0 dose of 150\\xa0 mg/kg by monitoring the recovery of body weight and the increase in the total protein in the cardiac muscle of rats and in muscle tissue homogenate, which is aimed to promote myofibrillar hypertrophy. Dry extract of Iris hungarica rhizomes reduced urea excretion, normalized metabolism, restored nitrogen balance, and inhibited protein catabolism. The results indicate that dry extract of Iris hungarica has the ability to correct protein metabolism, which is regulated in part by glucocorticoids, due to the high content of isoflavonoids and amino acids, and suggest that there is a\\xa0 potential use for this herbal product in the development of a\\xa0new drug aimed at correcting protein metabolism and muscular atrophy.',\n",

Chiral anesthetics possess a\\xa0stereogenic center in their molecules and thus exist as two enantiomers (S)-(+) and\\xa0(R)-(-). Although these chiral anesthetics are used as racemates, it is crucial to study besides the bioactivities of the racemic compounds also the biological activity and other properties of the particular enantiomers. The present survey discusses the drug category known as inhalational anesthetics in regard to their chiral aspects. These compounds exhibit marked differences between the (R) and (S)-enantiomers in their pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and toxicity. The main analytical technique employed in the enantioseparation of these compounds is gas chromatography (GC). This review lists the individual chiral phases (chiral selectors) used in the enantioseparation as well as in pharmacokinetic studies. The possibilities of preparation of these compounds in their enantiomerically pure form by means of stereoselective synthesis are also mentioned.',\n",

              " 'Background We aimed to provide personalized risk estimates for cardiac events (CEs) and life-threatening events in women with either type 1 or type 2 long QT. Methods and Results The prognostic model was derived from the Rochester Long QT Syndrome Registry, comprising 767 women with type 1 long QT (n=404) and type 2 long QT (n=363) from age 15 through 60\\xa0years. The risk prediction model included the following variables: genotype/mutation location, QTc-specific thresholds, history of syncope, and ß-blocker therapy. A model was developed with the end point of CEs (syncope, aborted cardiac arrest, or long QT syndrome-related sudden cardiac death), and was applied with the end point of life-threatening events (aborted cardiac arrest, sudden cardiac death, or appropriate defibrillator shocks). External validation was performed with data from the Mayo Clinic Genetic Heart Rhythm Clinic (N=467; type 1 long QT [n=286] and type 2 long QT [n=181]). The cumulative follow-up duration among the 767 enrolled women was 22\\xa0243 patient-years, during which 323 patients (42%) experienced =1 CE. Based on genotype-phenotype data, we identified 3 risk groups with 10-year projected rates of CEs ranging from 15%, 29%, to 51%. The corresponding 10-year projected rates of life-threatening events were 2%, 5%, and 14%. C statistics for the prediction model for the 2 respective end points were 0.68 (95% CI 0.65-0.71) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.66-0.76). Corresponding C statistics for the model in the external validation Mayo Clinic cohort were 0.65 (95% CI 0.60-0.70) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.70-0.84). Conclusions This is the first risk prediction model that provides absolute risk estimates for CEs and life-threatening events in women with type 1 or type 2 long QT based on personalized genotype-phenotype data.

              " 'Background Recent trials comparing catheter ablation to medical therapy in patients with heart failure (HF) with symptomatic atrial fibrillation despite first-line management have demonstrated a reduction in adverse outcomes. We performed an economic evaluation to estimate the cost-utility of catheter ablation as second line therapy in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Methods and Results A Markov model with health states of alive, dead, and alive with amiodarone toxicity was constructed, using the perspective of the Canadian healthcare payer. Patients in the alive states were at risk of HF and non-HF hospitalizations. Parameters were obtained from randomized trials and Alberta health system data for costs and outcomes. A lifetime time horizon was adopted, with discounting at 3.0% annually. Probabilistic and 1-way sensitivity analyses were performed. Costs are reported in 2018 Canadian dollars. A patient treated with catheter ablation experienced lifetime costs of $64\\xa0960 and 5.63 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), compared with $49\\xa0865 and 5.18 QALYs for medical treatment. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $35\\xa0360/QALY (95% CI, $21\\xa0518-77\\xa0419), with a 90% chance of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50\\xa0000/QALY. A minimum mortality reduction of 28%, or a minimum duration of benefit of >1 to 2\\xa0years was required for catheter ablation to be attractive at this threshold. Conclusions Catheter ablation is likely to be cost-effective as a second line intervention for patients with HF with symptomatic atrial fibrillation, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $35\\xa0360/QALY, as long as over half of the relative mortality benefit observed in extant trials is borne out in future studies.',\n",

To enhance participants' self-monitoring health behavior changes, the nurses used motivational interviewing and behavior change techniques based on the transtheoretical model.,This study results indicated that telenursing might be effective to improve the lifestyles-related behaviors in chronic diseases on the remote island of Osakikamijima, Japan.\",\n",
              " 'Background We assessed the associations between patient-clinician relationships (communication and involvement in shared decision-making [SDM]) and adherence to antihypertensive medications. Methods and Results The 2010 to 2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data were analyzed. A retrospective cohort study design was used to create a cohort of prevalent and new users of antihypertensive medications. We defined constructs of patient-clinician communication and involvement in SDM from patient responses to the standard questionnaires about satisfaction and access to care during the first year of surveys. Verified self-reported medication refill information collected during the second year of surveys was used to calculate medication refill adherence; adherence was defined as medication refill adherence =80%. Survey-weighted multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were used to measure the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI for the association between both patient-clinician constructs and adherence. Our analysis involved 2571 Black adult patients with hypertension (mean age of 58\\xa0years; SD, 14\\xa0years) who were either persistent (n=1788) or new users (n=783) of antihypertensive medications. Forty-five percent (n=1145) and 43% (n=1016) of the sample reported having high levels of communication and involvement in SDM, respectively. High, versus low, patient-clinician communication (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.14-1.67) and involvement in SDM (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.08-1.61) were both associated with adherence to antihypertensives after adjusting for multiple covariates. These associations persisted among a subgroup of new users of antihypertensive medications. Conclusions Patient-clinician communication and involvement in SDM are important predictors of optimal adherence to antihypertensive medication and should be targeted for improving adherence among Black adults with hypertension.',\n",
              " 'Background Patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) experience long waitlist times for heart transplantation (HTx) while a large proportion of donor hearts are refused. The goal of this study was to inform optimal donor selection for patients with ACHD listed for HTx by examining the impact of donor characteristics on post-HTx outcomes. Methods and Results Using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we conducted a retrospective analysis of patients aged =18\\xa0years listed for HTx in the United States between 2000 and 2016. We compared waitlist times between patients with ACHD and patients with noncongenital heart disease and constructed multivariate hazard models to identify donor characteristics associated with increased waitlist time. We then compared post-HTx survival between patients with ACHD and patients with noncongenital heart disease and constructed multivariate hazard models to identify donor characteristics associated with mortality. There were very few differences in donor characteristics between HTx recipients with ACHD and those with noncongenital heart disease. Status 1A-listed patients with ACHD experienced longer waitlist times compared with patients with noncongenital heart disease. Increased wait times were associated with some donor characteristics. Post-HTx outcomes varied over time, with patients with ACHD having inferior early mortality (0 to 30\\xa0days), similar intermediate mortality (31\\xa0days to 4\\xa0years), and superior late mortality (>4\\xa0years). We identified no donor characteristics associated with mortality to justify the observed differences in donor selection or waitlist time. Conclusions HTx candidates with ACHD wait longer for transplant but do not require unique donor selection criteria. HTx teams should consider liberalizing donor criteria and focusing only on evidence-based selection to improve waitlist outcomes and reduce the recipient-donor disparity.',\n",

Most known risk factors are otological or neurological, but general health and lifestyle can also precipitate the condition. Understanding these modifiable risk factors can help to identify vulnerable groups and can inform preventive actions to reduce likelihood of developing tinnitus. Smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI) and caffeine intake are all lifestyle risk factors hypothesized to be related to tinnitus. Nonetheless, research findings in support of those relationships are somewhat mixed.,A systematic review was conducted to identify all relevant studies on the specific risk factors. Findings were summarized using a narrative synthesis and meta-analysis, where possible.,Overall 384 studies were included, mostly using cross-sectional designs. Findings indicated significantly increased risk of tinnitus among current (based on 26 studies) and ever smokers (based on 16 studies) and among obese people (based on seven studies), but no effect of alcohol consumption (based on 11 studies). With respect to caffeine intake or coffee drinking, only three studies examined this risk factor and so we were unable to draw conclusions.,Our results contribute to quantifying the relationship between tinnitus and specific lifestyle-related risk factors, and we highlight some of the gaps and inconsistencies across published studies.',\n",

Applying neurofeedback (NFB) with the aim of changing these oscillatory patterns not only provides help for those who suffer from the phantom percept, but a promising foundation from which to probe influential factors. The reliable attribution of influential factors that potentially predict oscillatory changes during the course of NFB training may lead to the identification of subgroups of individuals that are more or less responsive to NFB training. The present study investigated oscillatory trajectories of delta (3-4Hz) and individual alpha (8.5-12Hz) during 15 NFB training sessions, based on a Latent Growth Curve framework. First, we found the desired enhancement of alpha, while delta was stable throughout the NFB training. Individual differences in tinnitus-specific variables and general-, as well as health-related quality of life predictors were largely unrelated to oscillatory change prior to and across the training. Only the predictors age and sex at baseline were clearly related to slow-wave delta, particularly so for older female individuals who showed higher delta power values from the start. Second, we confirmed a hierarchical cross-frequency association between the two frequency bands; however, in opposing directions to those anticipated in tinnitus. The establishment of individually tailored NFB protocols would boost this therapy's effectiveness in the treatment of tinnitus. In our analysis, we propose a conceptual groundwork toward this goal of developing more targeted treatment.\",\n",

However, the effects on patients' tinnitus experience itself are still largely unknown. This study seeks to test the hypothesis that the use of EMA negatively influences tinnitus experience in participants with severe tinnitus.,A multiple-baseline single-case experimental design included four severely affected tinnitus volunteers who were recruited online and randomized into different phasing schedules. Baseline phase (A) ranged from 11 to 24 days, followed by an EMA phase (B) for the remainder of the 33-day schedule. End-of-day diary assessments of tinnitus experience (e.g., annoyance, intrusiveness, mood) were visually inspected, and complemented with inferential statistics (randomization tests and Tau-U).,End-of-day diary data revealed no change in broadened median between phases. Nevertheless, tinnitus experience scores improved as variability decreased and a significant improvement in stress was observed through weighted Tau-U statistics.,Findings of this study corroborate that EMA assessment does not negatively affect tinnitus experience. On the contrary, participants may have improved. The underlying mechanism of improvements are still to be uncovered. Findings are limited to severely affected tinnitus sufferers at present.\",\n",
              " 'Tinnitus, a perception of ringing and buzzing sound in the ear, has not been completely understood yet. It is well known that tinnitus-related distress and loudness can change over time. However, proper comparability for the data collection approaches requires further focused studies. In this context, technology such as the use of mobile devices may be a promising approach. Repeated assessments of tinnitus-related distress and loudness in Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) studies require a short assessment, and a Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) is often used in this context. Yet, their comparability with psychometric questionnaires remains unclear and thus was the focus of this study. Research goals: The evaluation of the appropriateness of VAS in measuring tinnitus-related distress and loudness is pursued in this paper.,The Mini Tinnitus Questionnaire (Mini-TQ) measured tinnitus-related distress once. Tinnitus-related distress and tinnitus loudness were measured repeatedly using VAS on a daily basis during 7 days in the TrackYourTinnitus (TYT) smartphone app and were summarized per day using mean and median results. Then, correlations between summarized VAS tinnitus-related distress and summarized VAS tinnitus loudness, on the one side, and Mini-TQ, on the other side, were calculated.,Correlations between Mini-TQ and VAS tinnitus-related distress ranged between r = 0.36 and r = 0.52, while correlations between Mini-TQ and VAS tinnitus loudness ranged between r = 0.25 and r = 0.36. The more time difference between the Mini-TQ and the VAS assessments is, the lower the correlations between them. Mean and median VAS values per day resulted in similar correlations.,Mobile-based VAS seems to be an appropriate approach to utilize daily measurements of tinnitus-related distress.',\n",

Whilst there has been a notable increase in tinnitus research funding and tinnitus-related scientific publications in recent years, this is not keeping pace with other disciplines such as hearing loss. Tinnitus research is less attractive to industry funders, in particular because the field lacks consensus on many topics, objective measures, and treatment success stories. There is a clear need for even more funding, better quality studies, increased capacity, and more interdisciplinary working in the field. One important effort in this direction was the European School for Interdisciplinary Tinnitus research (ESIT) project. This EU-funded doctoral training program brought together a consortium of clinicians, academics, commercial partners, patient organizations, and public health experts. The program supported fundamental science and clinical research projects in order to advance treatments, develop innovative research methods, perform genetic and epidemiological studies, and establish a pan-European data resource. Underpinning the program was a comprehensive training curriculum designed to address the skills and researcher competencies defined by the Vitae Researcher Development Framework. This approach, reviewed in detail here, allowed for systematic identification of strengths and development needs, action planning, and review of achievements. We conclude the general need for increased capacity in the field, and coordinated efforts to both improve research quality and address fundamental issues that will attract and retain funding and researchers. ESIT provides an evidenced format for training in the field of tinnitus research.',\n",
              " 'Gender constitutes a major factor to consider when tailoring subtype-based therapies for tinnitus. Previous reports showed important differences between men and women concerning basic perceptual tinnitus characteristics (i.e., laterality, frequency, tinnitus loudness) as well as psychological reactions linked to this condition. Therapeutic approaches based on acoustic stimulation involve processes beyond a pure masking effect and consist of sound presentation temporarily altering or alleviating tinnitus perception via residual and/or lateral inhibition mechanisms. Presented stimuli may include pure tones, noise, and music adjusted to or modulated to filter out tinnitus pitch and therefore trigger reparative functional and structural changes in the auditory system. Furthermore, recent findings suggest that in tonal tinnitus, the presentation of pitch-adjusted sounds which were altered by a 10Hz modulation of amplitude was more efficient than unmodulated stimulation. In this paper, we investigate sex differences in the outcome of different variants of acoustic stimulation, looking for factors revealing predictive value in the efficiency of tinnitus relief.',\n",
              " 'The spatial percept of tinnitus is hypothesized as an important variable for tinnitus subtyping. Hearing asymmetry often associates with tinnitus laterality, but not always. One of the methodological limitations for cross-study comparisons is how the variables for hearing asymmetry and tinnitus spatial perception are defined. In this study, data from two independent datasets were combined (n=833 adults, age ranging from 20 to 91 years, 404 males, 429 females) to investigate characteristics of subgroups with different tinnitus spatial perception focusing on hearing asymmetry. Three principle findings emerged. First, a hearing asymmetry variable emphasizing the maximum interaural difference most strongly discriminated unilateral from bilateral tinnitus. Merging lateralized bilateral tinnitus (perceived in both ears but worse in one side) with unilateral tinnitus weakened this relationship. Second, there was an association between unilateral tinnitus and ipsilateral asymmetric hearing. Third, unilateral and bilateral tinnitus were phenotypically distinct, with unilateral tinnitus being characterized by older age, asymmetric hearing, more often wearing one hearing aid, older age at tinnitus onset, shorter tinnitus duration, and higher percentage of time being annoyed by tinnitus. We recommend that careful consideration is given to the definitions of hearing asymmetry and tinnitus spatial perception in order to improve the comparability of findings across studies.',\n",

The minimum masking level (MML) is a clinical tool defined as the minimum intensity of a masking sound required to cover tinnitus. Understanding the differences among masking patterns in patients could facilitate the task of subtyping tinnitus. Here, we studied the variability of hearing thresholds and MMLs among patients with tinnitus to identify tinnitus subgroups. A population of 366 consecutive patients from a specialized tinnitus clinic were included in the analysis. Hearing thresholds and MMLs were determined for octave frequencies from 0.25 to 8kHz, as well as for 3 and 6kHz. Subjects were divided into two groups according to whether their tinnitus was maskable (M, 329 subjects) or non-maskable (NM, 37 subjects). Hearing thresholds and tinnitus loudness did not differ significantly between both groups. The dimensionality of the data was reduced by means of principal component analysis (PCA), and the largest resulting components were used for clustering the data. The cluster analysis resulted in five clusters with differences in tinnitus pitch, lateralization, hearing thresholds and MML, as well as on age and gender. Clusters differed in contours of hearing thresholds and MML, describing patterns of low or high thresholds in combination with low or high MML. The clustering solution presented a low silhouette value (0.45), implying that the clustering is weak and could be artificial. The analysis pointed out the diversity across tinnitus patients. Our results suggest that there might be a continuum of patients' characteristics rather than discrete subgroups.\",\n",

All patients aged 16 to 74 years and receiving at least two long-term treatments at admission were considered eligible. High-risk medications were defined on the basis of a pharmacovigilance study, which identified the drugs most involved in serious adverse effects reported in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region in non-elderly adults.

High risk-medications (HRM) existing at admission were antithrombotics (52.2%) and antipsychotics (22.4%). MR resulted in treatment changes in 37% of patients admitted with at-risk medications vs. 8.7% of those admitted without such (P=0.001). Overall, the mean number of treatment changes performed after MR was of 1 (95%CI 0.4-1.6) in patients with high-risk medication at admission and of 0.2 (95%CI 0-0.4) in patients without such. MR-induced treatment changes assessed as clinically major at least once by pharmacists or clinicians was greater in HRM group (43.5%) than in non-HRM group (31.6%).

              " \"An ecosystem services (ES) approach to chemical risk assessment has many potential advantages, but there are also substantial challenges regarding its implementation. We report the findings of a multi-stakeholder workshop that evaluated the feasibility of adopting an ES approach to chemical risk assessment using currently available tools and data. Also evaluated is the added value such an approach would bring to environmental decision making. The aim was to build consensus across disparate stakeholders and to co-produce a common understanding of the regulatory benefits and feasibility of implementing an ES approach in European chemicals regulation. Workshop discussions were informed by proof of concept studies and resulted in the development of a novel tiered framework for assessing chemical risk to ES delivery. There was consensus on the substantial added value of adopting an ES-based approach for regulatory decision making. Ecosystem services provide a common currency and a 'unifying approach' across environmental compartments, stressors and regulatory frameworks. The ES approach informs prioritisation of risk and remedial action and aids risk communication and risk management. It facilitates a more holistic assessment, enables ES trade-offs to be compared across alternative interventions, and supports comparative risk assessments and a socio-economic analysis of management options and decisions. Key to realising this added value is a shift away from using a single threshold value to categorise risk, towards a consideration of the exposure-effect distribution for individual ES of interest. Also required is the development of an integrated systems-level approach across regulatory frameworks and agreement on specific protection goals and scenarios for framing environmental risk assessments. The need to further develop tools for extrapolating toxicity data to service providers and ES delivery, including logic chains and ecological production functions, was highlighted.

              " 'The protein deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) play important roles in the development of insulin resistance. In glomerular podocytes, crosstalk between these two enzymes may be altered under hyperglycemic conditions. SIRT1 protein levels and activity and AMPK phosphorylation decrease under hyperglycemic conditions, with concomitant inhibition of the effect of insulin on glucose uptake into these cells. Nitric oxide (NO)-dependent regulatory signaling pathways have been shown to be downregulated under diabetic conditions. The present study examined the involvement of the NO synthase (NOS)/NO pathway in the regulation of SIRT1-AMPK signaling and glucose uptake in podocytes. We examined the effects of NOS/NO pathway alterations on SIRT1/AMPK signaling and glucose uptake using pharmacological tools and a small-interfering transfection approach. We also examined the ability of the NOS/NO pathway to protect podocytes against high glucose-induced alterations of SIRT1/AMPK signaling and insulin-dependent glucose uptake. Inhibition of the NOS/NO pathway reduced SIRT1 protein levels and activity, leading to a decrease in AMPK phosphorylation and blockade of the effect of insulin on glucose uptake. Treatment with the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) prevented high glucose-induced decreases in SIRT1 and AMPK activity and increased GLUT4 protein expression, thereby improving glucose uptake in podocytes. These findings suggest that inhibition of the NOS/NO pathway may result in alterations of the effects of insulin on glucose uptake in podocytes. In turn, the enhancement of NOS/NO pathway activity may prevent these deleterious effects of high glucose concentrations, thus bidirectionally stimulating the SIRT1-AMPK reciprocal activation loop.',\n",
              " 'Tubers of Curcuma wenyujin are rich in essential oils, mainly various sesquiterpenes, showing antibacterial, anti-viral and anti-tumor effects. However, the molecular mechanism of C. wenyujin is deficient and related sesquiterpene synthases are still unclear. In this study, the transcriptome data of tubers and leaves from C. wenyujin were obtained and assembled into 78\\xa0092 unigenes. Of them, 244 unigenes were predicted to be involved in terpenoid biosynthesis while 131 unigenes were categorized as the Terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (TBB) term. Twenty-two unigenes possessed terpene synthase domain; five were predicted to be sesquiterpene synthases. Of the 208 unigenes annotated as cytochromes P450, 8 unigenes with full-length coding sequences were part of the CYP71 clade that primarily may perform hydroxylations of specialized metabolites. Furthermore, Ten DEGs related to the C5 precursor supply and sesquiterpene synthesis were validated by Real-time PCR; that showed a close correspondence with transcriptome sequence. A novel germacrene B synthase (CwGBS) and a-santalene synthase (CwSS) were identified in metabolically engineering E. coli. This study provided the first de novo transcriptome comparative analysis of leaf and tuber tissues from C. wenyujin, aiming to understand genetic mechanisms. Key genes involved in the biosynthesis of sesquiterpene will help for revealing the underlying mechanisms of C. wenyujin.',\n",

During this process, the epithelial cells lose their polarity and acquire mesenchymal properties. In addition to embryonic development, EMT is also well-known to participate in tissue repair, inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor metastasis. In the present review, we address the basics of epithelial to mesenchymal transition during both development and disease conditions and emphasize the role of various transcription factors and miRNAs involved in the process.',\n",
              " 'The epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is inherently linked to host mating dynamics. Studies across many taxa show that adult sex ratio, a major determinant of host mating dynamics, is often skewed - sometimes strongly - toward males or females. However, few predictions exist for the effects of skewed sex ratio on STI epidemiology, and none when coupled with sex biased disease characteristics. Here we use mathematical modelling to examine how interactions between sex ratio and disease characteristics affect STI prevalence in males and females. Notably, we find that while overall disease prevalence peaks at equal sex ratios, prevalence per sex peaks at skewed sex ratios. Furthermore, disease characteristics, sex-biased or not, drive predictable differences in male and female STI prevalence as sex ratio varies, with higher transmission and lower virulence generally increasing differences between the sexes for a given sex ratio. Our work reveals new insights into how STI prevalence in males and females depends on a complex interaction between host population sex ratio and disease characteristics.',\n",
              " \"The n-back task is one of the most commonly used working memory (WM) paradigms in cognitive neuroscience. Converging evidence suggests activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and pupil dilation [a proxy for locus coeruleus (LC) activation] during this task. However, it remains unclear whether the lateral PFC and the LC are functionally associated during n-back task performance. This study's aim was to examine the relationship between changes in lateral PFC activity and the pupil diameter and to evaluate the effect of WM load on such relationship during the n-back task. Thirty-nine healthy young adults (10 males, 29 females) underwent a number n-back paradigm with 0- and 3-back conditions. Their prefrontal hemodynamics and changes in pupil size during task performance were simultaneously measured using a 16-channel functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device and a wearable eye tracker. Young adults exhibited significant activation in the bilateral lateral PFC and significant increases in pupil size when the WM load was high (i.e., 3-back) but not low (i.e., 0-back) compared with the resting period. Interestingly, significant positive correlations were found between changes in lateral PFC activity and pupil size during the 0-back task only. These correlations tended to be stronger during the 0-back than the 3-back condition. Thus, the functional relationship between the lateral PFC and the LC may vary at different load levels during the n-back task. Our findings have important implications for neuropsychiatric research and support concurrent fNIRS and pupillometric measurements for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying WM processing.\",\n",
              " 'When we read a word or see an object, conceptual meaning is automatically accessed. However, previous research investigating non-perceptual sensitivity to semantic class has employed active tasks. In this fMRI study, we tested whether conceptual representations in regions constituting the semantic network are invoked during passive semantic access and whether these representations are modulated by the need to access deeper knowledge. Seventeen healthy subjects performed a semantically active typicality judgment task and a semantically passive phonetic decision task, in both the written and the spoken input-modalities. Stimuli consisted of one hundred forty-four concepts drawn from six semantic categories. Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) revealed that the left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), posterior ventral temporal cortex (pVTC) and pars triangularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) showed a stronger sensitivity to semantic category when active rather than passive semantic access is required. Using a cross-task training/testing classifier, we determined that conceptual representations were not only active in these regions during passive semantic access but that the neural representation of these categories was common to both active and passive access. Collectively, these results show that while representations in the pMTG, pVTC and IFG are strongly modulated by active conceptual access, consistent representational patterns are present during active and passive conceptual access in these same regions.',\n",
              " 'The rubber hand illusion (RHI) is a phenomenon whereby participants recognize a fake hand as their own. Studies have examined the effects of observing fake hand movements after the RHI on brain sensorimotor activity, although results remain controversial. To address these discrepancies, we investigated the effects of observation of fake hand rotation after the RHI on sensorimotor mu (µ: 8-13\\xa0Hz) and beta (ß: 15-25\\xa0Hz) rhythm event-related desynchronization (ERD) using electroencephalography (EEG). Questionnaire results and proprioceptive drift revealed that the RHI occurred in participants when their invisible hand and fake visible hand were stroked synchronously but not during asynchronous stroking. Independent component (IC) clustering from EEG data during movement observation identified three IC clusters, including the right sensorimotor, left sensorimotor, and left occipital cluster. In the right sensorimotor cluster, we observed distinct modulation of µ and ß ERD during fake hand rotation. Illusory ownership over the fake hand enhanced µ ERD but inversely attenuated ß ERD. Further, the extent of µ ERD correlated with proprioceptive drift, but not with questionnaire ratings, whereas the converse results were obtained for ß ERD. No ownership-dependent ERD modulation was detected in the left sensorimotor cluster. Alpha (a: 8-13\\xa0Hz) rhythm ERD of the left occipital cluster was smaller in the synchronous condition than in the asynchronous condition, but a ERD was not correlated with questionnaire rating or drift. These findings suggest that observing embodied fake hand rotation induces distinct cortical processing in sensorimotor brain areas.',\n",
              " 'The extent to which action and perception systems of the brain are involved in semantic comprehension remains controversial. Whether figurative language, such as metaphors and idioms, is grounded in sensory-motor systems is especially contentious. Here, we used high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) in healthy adults to examine the role of the left-hemisphere motor cortex during the comprehension of action sentences, relative to comprehension of sentences with visual verbs. Action sentences were divided into three types: literal, metaphoric, or idiomatic. This allowed us to ask whether processing of action verbs used in figurative contexts relies on motor cortex. The results revealed that action sentence comprehension response times were facilitated relative to the visual sentence control. Significant interaction relative to visual sentences was observed for literal, metaphoric, and idiomatic action sentences with HD-tDCS of the motor cortex. These results suggest that the left motor cortex is functionally involved in action sentence comprehension. Furthermore, this involvement exists when the action content of the sentences is figurative, for both idiomatic and metaphoric cases. The results provide evidence for functional links between conceptual and action systems of the brain.',\n",
              " 'Self-construal (orientations of independence and interdependence) is a fundamental concept that guides human behaviour, and it is linked to a large number of brain regions. However, understanding the connectivity of these regions and the critical principles underlying these self-functions are lacking. Because brain activity linked to self-related processes are intrinsic, the resting-state method has received substantial attention. Here, we focused on resting-state functional connectivity matrices based on brain asymmetry as indexed by the differential partition of the connectivity located in mirrored positions of the two hemispheres, hemispheric specialization measured using the intra-hemispheric (left or right) connectivity, brain communication via inter-hemispheric interactions, and global connectivity as the sum of the two intra-hemispheric connectivity. Combining machine learning techniques with hypothesis-driven network mapping approaches, we demonstrated that orientations of independence and interdependence were best predicted by the asymmetric matrix compared to brain communication, hemispheric specialization, and global connectivity matrices. The network results revealed that there were distinct asymmetric connections between the default mode network, the salience network and the executive control network which characterise independence and interdependence. These analyses shed light on the importance of brain asymmetry in understanding how complex self-functions are optimally represented in the brain networks.',\n",
              " 'Bimanual motor control declines during ageing, affecting the ability of older adults to maintain independence. An important underlying factor is cortical atrophy, particularly affecting frontal and parietal areas in older adults. As these regions and their interplay are highly involved in bimanual motor preparation, we investigated age-related connectivity changes between prefrontal and premotor areas of young and older adults during the preparatory phase of complex bimanual movements using high-density electroencephalography. Generative modelling showed that excitatory inter-hemispheric prefrontal to premotor coupling in older adults predicted age-group affiliation and was associated with poor motor-performance. In contrast, excitatory intra-hemispheric prefrontal to premotor coupling enabled older adults to maintain motor-performance at the cost of lower movement speed. Our results disentangle the complex interplay in the prefrontal-premotor network during movement preparation underlying reduced bimanual control and the well-known speed-accuracy trade-off seen in older adults.',\n",
              " 'Mapping the structural and functional connectivity of the central nervous system has become a key area within neuroimaging research. While detailed network structures across the entire brain have been probed using animal models, non-invasive neuroimaging in humans has thus far been dominated by cortical investigations. Beyond the cortex, subcortical nuclei have traditionally been less accessible due to their smaller size and greater distance from radio frequency coils. However, major neuroimaging developments now provide improved signal and the resolution required to study these structures. Here, we present an overview of the connectivity between the amygdala, brainstem, cerebellum, spinal cord and the rest of the brain. While limitations to their imaging and analyses remain, we also provide some recommendations and considerations for mapping brain connectivity beyond the cortex.',\n",
              " \"Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is a widely recognized neuroimaging technique to evaluate the microstructure of brain white matter. The objective of this study is to establish an improved automated DWI marker for estimating white matter integrity and investigating ageing related cognitive decline. The concept of Wasserstein distance was introduced to help establish a new measure: difference in distribution functions (DDF), which captures the difference of reshaping one's mean diffusivity (MD) distribution to a reference MD distribution. This new DWI measure was developed using a population-based cohort (n=19,369) from the UK Biobank. Validation was conducted using the data drawn from two independent cohorts: the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study, a community-dwelling sample (n=402), and the Renji Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Cohort Study (RCCS), which consisted of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) patients (n=171) and cognitively normal controls (NC) (n=43). DDF was associated with age across all three samples and better explained the variance of changes than other established DWI measures, such as fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD). Significant correlations between DDF and cognition were found in the UK Biobank cohort and the MAS cohort. Binary logistic analysis and receiver operator characteristic curve analysis of RCCS demonstrated that DDF had higher sensitivity in distinguishing CSVD patients from NC than the other DWI measures. To demonstrate the flexibility of DDF, we calculated regional DDF which also showed significant correlation with age and cognition. DDF can be used as a marker for monitoring the white matter microstructural changes and ageing related cognitive decline in the elderly.\",\n",

Platelet aggregation was measured in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) incubated with 30\\xa0µM CxxCpep or vehicle. CxxCpep inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation but exerted no effect in TRAP-6-stimulated platelets. PRP was incubated with DCFDA to measure oxidative burst upon platelet adhesion to collagen. Results showed that CxxCpep decreased oxidative burst in platelets adhered to immobilized collagen while the number of adherent cells was unaffected. Furthermore, flow cytometry studies using a FITC-maleimide showed that the GPVI agonist CRP stimulated an increase in free thiols on the platelet outer membrane, which was inhibited by CxxCpep. Finally, CxxCpep inhibited platelet mitochondrial respiration upon activation with collagen, but not with thrombin.,Our data suggest that pecPDI is a potential modulator of GPVI-mediated redox regulation mechanisms and that CxxCpep can be further exploited as a template for new antiplatelet compounds.',\n",
              " \"Vertebrate skeletal muscle development and repair relies on the precise control of Wnt signaling. Dact1 (Dapper/Frodo) is an important modulator of Wnt signaling, interacting with key components of the various Wnt transduction pathways. Here, we characterized Dact1 mRNA and protein expression in chicken and mouse fetal muscles in vivo and during the differentiation of chick primary and mouse C2C12 myoblasts in vitro. We also performed in silico analysis to investigate Dact1 gene expression in human myopathies, and evaluated the Dact1 protein structure to seek an explanation for the accumulation of Dact1 protein aggregates in the nuclei of myogenic cells. Our results show for the first time that in both chicken and mouse, Dact1 is expressed during myogenesis, with a strong upregulation as cells engage in terminal differentiation, cell cycle withdrawal and cell fusion. In humans, Dact1 expression was found to be altered in specific muscle pathologies, including muscular dystrophies. Our bioinformatic analyses of Dact1 proteins revealed long intrinsically disordered regions, which may underpin the ability of Dact1 to interact with its many partners in the various Wnt pathways. In addition, we found that Dact1 has strong propensity for liquid-liquid phase separation, a feature that explains its ability to form nuclear aggregates and points to a possible role as a molecular 'on'-'off' switch. Taken together, our data suggest Dact1 as a candidate, multi-faceted regulator of amniote myogenesis with a possible pathophysiological role in human muscular diseases.\",\n",

A total of 989 and 1534 whey proteins were characterized in donkey and bovine milk, respectively. Furthermore, 623 whey proteins were found in both groups, and 229 differentially expressed whey proteins (DEWPs) were identified. Among the common proteins, 66 DEWPs were upregulated and 163 were downregulated in donkey milk compared to those in bovine milk. Gene Ontology analysis revealed the cellular components, biological processes, and molecular functions of these DEWPs. Metabolic pathway analysis suggested that most DEWPs were associated with endocytosis, platelet activation, and phagocytosis. These results improve our understanding of the differences between donkey and bovine whey proteins and provide important information regarding these proteins as nutritional and functional factors in dairy product formulations from multiple milk sources.',\n",

VOCs formed during stage 1 and 2 were originate from raw material, and its oxidation (i.e. enzymatic browning) and thermal degradation (i.e. lipid oxidation, Maillard reactions, Strecker degradation). In stage 3 and 4, the caramelization and melanoidin degradation also occurred, while in stage 5, the thermal degradation continues, followed by microbial activity. Chemometric analysis allowed to identify 35 VOCs as potential markers for processing control by the producers and as guarantee of the typicality and authenticity of SCH.

The results indicated that certain Cd was released into the digestive juice after in vitro digestion with a bioaccessibility of 20-63% for rice and 3-32% for leafy vegetables, and the released portion was partially absorbed by Caco-2 cells with a bioavailability of 2-21% for rice and 0.2-13% for leafy vegetables. The results obtained from the toxicokinetic model revealed that the predicted urinary Cd values from the estimated daily intake (EDI) of Cd, which accounted for bioaccessibility and bioavailability, were consistent with the actual measured values, and the EDIs were considerably lower than the acceptable daily intake. This suggests that the bioaccessibility and bioavailability adjusted dietary Cd exposure should be more precise.

Based on the 16S rRNA analysis of wastewater sludge, it was found that Providencia rettgeri MB-IIT strain was active and able to grow in higher TCS concentration. The identified bacterial strain was able to use TCS as carbon and energy source for its growth.

              " \"An original rationale is proposed to explain the controversial role of aluminum, a common substitutive element in ferrihydrite (Fh), on arsenic adsorption. The adsorption of arsenic on synthetic Al-for-Fe substituted Fh (AlFh) with up to 20\\xa0mol% Al was investigated at pH 5 and 8. The reduced interplanar spacings observed by selected area electron diffraction show that all AlFh samples are isomorphically substituted up to 20\\xa0mol% Al. A 15\\xa0mol% Al incorporation increases the arsenic uptake by 28%. In contrast, the Langmuir binding constants decrease, suggesting weaker bonds. Arsenic uptake reduces by 50% as pH rises from 5 to 8. The Al-for-Fe substitution in ferrihydrite causes structural defects, proton-compensated by OH groups, as indicated by the Vegard rule deviation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates the increase in the relative amount of surface M-OH sites (45% to 77%) with Al concentration (AlFh-0 to AlFh-20), respectively. The enhanced As(V) uptake was ascribed to the insertion of hydroxyls on the Fh structural defects.

              " 'Air-transmissible pathogenic viruses, such as influenza viruses and coronaviruses, are some of the most fatal strains and spread rapidly by air, necessitating quick and stable measurements from sample air volumes to prevent further spread of diseases and to take appropriate steps rapidly. Measurements of airborne viruses generally require their collection into liquids or onto solid surfaces, with subsequent hydrosolization and then analysis using the growth method, nucleic-acid-based techniques, or immunoassays. Measurements can also be performed in real time without sampling, where species-specific determination is generally disabled. In this review, we introduce some recent advancements in the measurement of pathogenic airborne viruses. Air sampling and measurement technologies for viral aerosols are reviewed, with special focus on the effects of air sampling on damage to the sampled viruses and their measurements. Measurement of pathogenic airborne viruses is an interdisciplinary research area that requires understanding of both aerosol technology and biotechnology to effectively address the issues. Hence, this review is expected to provide some useful guidelines regarding appropriate air sampling and virus detection methods for particular applications.',\n",
              " 'Relapses of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) result in cumulative neurologic disabilities, are unpredictable, and are interspersed with remissions. Pain in NMOSD is often severe and intractable, with a significant impact on patient quality of life (QoL). We performed a more detailed analysis of previously published survey data on the association of pain and QoL, comparing patients who were seropositive and seronegative for antibodies against aquaporin-4 (AQP4-IgG).,We conducted a secondary analysis of questionnaire data from 193 NMOSD patients across North America. The study population was predominantly female (88.6%) and aged 19-76\\xa0years. Results were reported for three groups: AQP4-IgG-seropositive (61.1%), AQP4-IgG-seronegative and the total cohort including patients with unknown serostatus. We measured the strength of associations and interactions between pain and variables including QoL, patient satisfaction, frequency of hospital visits, and number of relapses versus other symptoms.,Pain severity was the strongest negative predictor of QoL. In the total and AQP4-IgG-seropositive groups, pain was the most common symptom that patients wanted their physician to be concerned about; in the AQP4-IgG-seronegative group, this was fatigue. For all patients, frequent hospital visits and relapses were associated with more severe pain, but not frequency of NMOSD specialist visits. Patients without recent relapse still commonly reported moderate or severe pain (>25%).,This study confirms the heavy burden of pain on NMOSD patients and its effect on QoL and healthcare utilization. Prevention or early treatment of relapses and more effective pain management may reduce this burden.',\n",
              " 'Billion tons of post-consumer Tetra Pak cartons are discarded annually as land and ocean wastes, creating significant environmental problems and resource losses. Recycling of the carton wastes is hindered by its multi-material compositions and low values of the recycled products. In this study, a novel upcycling of the cartons was investigated. A post-consumer carton consisting of paper, polyolefin, and polyamide was directly converted in 210-230\\xa0°C tetrahydrofuran containing 10-20\\xa0mM acid to produce up to 19.2% of levoglucosenone and 8.6% of furfural by selectively decomposing paper fraction. The remaining solids containing mostly intact polyethylene and polyamide but also a smaller fraction of paper-derived char were separated using a solvent-dissolution method. The xylene-soluble fraction was a recycled polymer similar to the original polyethylene, which was verified by its functional groups, the composition of the pyrolysis products, and the melt rheology results. The xylene-insoluble fraction was a mixture of polyamide and paper-derived char. Upon pyrolysis, caprolactam was produced as the only major vapor product. The remaining, thermally stable paper-derived char could be used as a high-quality solid fuel. Overall, the demonstrated recycling method could potentially maximize the values of the products recovered from carton wastes.',\n",

The Arboreto library was incorporated into a user-friendly web-based application for malaria researchers ( http://malboost.bi.up.ac.za ). This application will assist researchers with gaining an in depth understanding of transcriptomic datasets.,The web application for MALBoost was built in Python-Flask with Redis and Celery workers for queue submission handling, which execute the Arboreto suite algorithms. A submission of 5-50 regulators and total expression set of 5200 genes is permitted. The program runs in a point-and-click web user interface built using Bootstrap4 templates. Post-analysis submission, users are redirected to a status page with run time estimates and ultimately a download button upon completion. Result updates or failure updates will be emailed to the users.,A web-based application with an easy-to-use interface is presented with a use case validation of AP2-G and AP2-I. The validation set incorporates cross-referencing with ChIP-seq and transcriptome datasets. For AP2-G, 5 ChIP-seq targets were significantly enriched with seven more targets presenting with strong evidence of validated targets.,The MALBoost application provides the first tool for easy interfacing and efficiently allows gene regulatory network construction for Plasmodium. Additionally, access is provided to a pre-compiled network for use as reference framework. Validation for sexually committed ring-stage parasite targets of AP2-G, suggests the algorithm was effective in resolving traditionally low-level signatures even in bulk RNA datasets.',\n",
              " 'Brief treatment (BT) can be an effective, short-term, and low-cost treatment option for many people who misuse alcohol and drugs. However, inconsistent implementation is suggested to result in BT that often looks and potentially costs similar to regular outpatient care. Prior research is also rife with inconsistent operationalizations regarding the measurement of BT received by patients. As such, there is a need to more explicitly identify and document variations in BT practice.,A qualitative investigation of BT in four Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) was undertaken as a sub study of a larger clinical trial. Researchers interviewed 12 staff (administrators and clinicians) involved in BT oversight, referral, or delivery within the four FQHCs. Data were analyzed following an inductive approach guided by the primary research questions.,Findings demonstrate considerable differences in how BT was conceptualized and implemented within the FQHCs. This included a variety of ways in which BT was presented and described to patients that likely impacts how they perceive the BT they receive, including potentially not understanding they received substance use disorder treatment at all.,The findings raise questions regarding the validity of prior research, demonstrating more objective definitions of BT and fidelity checklists are needed to ensure integrity of results. Future work in this area should seek to understand BT as practiced among a larger sample of providers and the direct experiences and perspectives of patients. There is also a need for more consistent implementation, quality assurance guidelines, and standardized stage of change assessments to aid practitioners.',\n",

The patients' average age was 38 years (range, 16-61 years). The mean follow-up period was 13 months (range, 10-18 months). At the final follow-up, the functional recovery of the injured hand was assessed and compared between the modified and traditional technique groups. In addition, the functional recovery of the injured hand was compared with that of the uninjured hand within the modified technique group.,All patients recovered well, with no cases of infection or nonunion. Compared with the traditional technique group, the modified technique group had a shorter operative time, lower postoperative visual analogue scale pain score, better effective range of motion score of the first carpometacarpal joint (Kapandji score), and had almost no need for auxiliary plaster fixation, enabling functional exercise to be started earlier. Within the modified technique group, the mean hand grip strength, pinch strength, and Kapandji score on the injured side did not significantly differ to the values on the uninjured side in both the extra-articular and intra-articular fracture subgroups. While the abduction and flexion-extension arcs of the thumb on the injured hand were significantly smaller than those on the uninjured hand in both the extra-articular and intra-articular fracture subgroups, the patients felt clinically well with respect to daily activities and strength.,The percutaneous parallel K-wire and interlocking fixation technique is simple, effective, and economical for first metacarpal base fractures.\",\n",

This trait attributes to the acquired stem-like property of tumor cells and can impact patient prognosis. The objective of this study was to comparatively analyze the expression and significance of SOX2 and OCT4 in various types of odontogenic cysts and tumors.,Fifty-five cases of odontogenic cysts and tumors, including 15 ameloblastomas (AM), 5 adenomatoid odontogenic tumors (AOT), 5 ameloblastic fibromas (AF), 5 calcifying odontogenic cysts (COC), 10 dentigerous cysts (DC) and 15 odontogenic keratocysts (OKC) were investigated for the expression of SOX2 and OCT4 immunohistochemically.,Most OKCs (86.7 %) and all AFs expressed SOX2 in more than 50 % of epithelial cells. Its immunoreactivity was moderate-to-strong in all epithelial cell types in both lesions. In contrast, SOX2 expression was undetectable in AOTs and limited to the ameloblast-like cells in a minority of AM and COC cases. Most DCs showed positive staining in less than 25 % of cystic epithelium. Significantly greater SOX2 expression was noted in OKC compared with DC or AM, and in AF compared with COC or AOT. OCT4 rarely expressed in odontogenic lesions with the immunoreactivity being mild and present exclusively in OKCs.,SOX2 is differentially expressed in odontogenic cysts and tumors. This could be related to their diverse cells of origin or stages of histogenesis. The overexpression of SOX2 and OCT4 in OKC indicates the acquired stem-like property. Future studies should investigate whether the overexpression of OCT4 and SOX2 contributes to the aggressive behaviors of the tumors.',\n",
              " \"Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide. When PPH occurs, early identification of bleeding and prompt management using evidence-based guidelines, can avert most PPH-related severe morbidities and deaths. However, adherence to the World Health Organization recommended practices remains a critical challenge. A potential solution to inefficient and inconsistent implementation of evidence-based practices is the application of a 'clinical care bundle' for PPH management. A clinical care bundle is a set of discrete, evidence-based interventions, administered concurrently, or in rapid succession, to every eligible person, along with teamwork, communication, and cooperation. Once triggered, all bundle components must be delivered. The E-MOTIVE project aims to improve the detection and first response management of PPH through the implementation of the E-MOTIVE bundle, which consists of (1) Early PPH detection using a calibrated drape, (2) uterine Massage, (3) Oxytocic drugs, (4) Tranexamic acid, (5) Intra Venous fluids, and (6) genital tract Examination and escalation when necessary. The objective of this paper is to describe the protocol for the formative phase of the E-MOTIVE project, which aims to design an implementation strategy to support the uptake of this bundle into practice.,We will use behavior change and implementation science frameworks [e.g. capability, opportunity, motivation and behavior (COM-B) and theoretical domains framework (TDF)] to guide data collection and analysis, in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania. There are four methodological components: qualitative interviews; surveys; systematic reviews; and design workshops. We will triangulate findings across data sources, participant groups, and countries to explore factors influencing current PPH detection and management, and potentially influencing E-MOTIVE bundle implementation. We will use these findings to develop potential strategies to improve implementation, which will be discussed and agreed with key stakeholders from each country in intervention design workshops.,This formative protocol outlines our strategy for the systematic development of the E-MOTIVE implementation strategy. This focus on implementation considers what it would take to support roll-out and implementation of the E-MOTIVE bundle. Our approach therefore aims to maximize internal validity in the trial alongside future scalability, and implementation of the E-MOTIVE bundle in routine practice, if proven to be effective.,ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04341662.\",\n",

Mucosal thickening is one of the key radiographic features of chronic maxillary sinusitis. The aim of this study was to identify the location of the AMOs and investigate the association between Mucosal Thickening [MT] and AMO using Cone Beam Computed Tomography [CBCT].,CBCT scans of 400 maxillary sinuses from the records of 200 patients who seeked various dental treatments at the Thumbay Dental Hospital, Gulf Medical University, Ajman, United Arab Emirates were evaluated. The incidence, anatomical position and maximal length of accessory maxillary ostia (AMO) in the maxillary antrum were reviewed using CBCT by two examiners. The association between MTs and AMOs were also analysed.,Among the 200 CBCT scans, 131 belonged to male patients and 69 scans belonged to female subjects within the age group of 18-65 years (mean age 41.32 years). AMOs were found in 142 maxillary antra (35.5 %). The inter-observer reliability for using CBCT to detect AMO was (k = 0.83). There was no significant difference in the frequency of AMOs when the age (P = 0.19) and gender (P = 0.54) distribution were considered. Sinuses with AMOs, showed significantly greater frequency of MTs (p = 0.001). AMOs with maximal length of less than 1mm were most commonly observed (51.40 %). AMOs with larger greater maximal length were associated with higher degrees of MT. The location of the AMOs, were not affected by the degree of MT.,The study demonstrates a clear association between degree of MT and occurrence of AMO in the maxillary sinus. However, the location of the AMO is independent of the degree of the MT. There is a greater probability of finding an AMO in the maxillary sinus if the MT in the sinus is more than 3 mm.',\n",

This study aimed to develop a noninvasive measurement method using a three-dimensional electromagnetic sensor system (EMS) to quantitatively assess and characterize the normal DRUJ movement in healthy volunteers.,The DRUJ movement was mimicked using both a block model and saw bone. Movement of the models was measured by EMS, and the accuracy and reproducibility of the measurements were assessed. In vivo measurement was performed in a sitting position with the elbow flexed and the forearm pronated. One sensor each was attached to the distal radial shaft and the ulnar head. The examiners fixed the distal radius and the carpal bones, moved the ulnar head from the dorsal to the volar side and measured the dorsovolar translation. The volar translation was measured by EMS and ultrasonography, and the correlation coefficient was calculated. The dorsovolar translation was evaluated in 14 healthy volunteers (7 men and 7 women) by three hand surgeons. The intraclass and inter-rater correlation coefficients (ICCs), the differences between the dominant and non-dominant sides and between men and women were assessed.,A new measurement method using EMS could evaluate DRUJ movement with high accuracy, reproducibility, and intra- and inter-rater reliability. In healthy volunteers, the dorsovolar ulnar head translation was 6.00 mm. The difference between the dominant and non-dominant sides was < 1.0 mm with no significant difference. EMS provided an objective, non-invasive, real-time assessment of dynamic changes in the DRUJ. These findings could be useful in the treatment of patients with DRUJ instability.',\n",

Disease resolution till Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) has been a general treatment goal, but there is limited information on this subset of patients who achieve this.,All consenting patients of the Monash Lupus Cohort who had at least 12 months of observation were included. HDAS was defined as SLEDAI-2K = 10 ever, and HDAS episode as the period from the first HDAS clinic visit until attainment of LLDAS. We examined the associations of different HDAS patterns with the likelihood of damage accrual.,Of 342 SLE patients, 151 experienced HDAS at least once, accounting for 298 HDAS episodes. The majority of HDAS patients (76.2%) experienced Recurrent HDAS (> 1 HDAS visit), and a smaller subset (47.7%) had Persistent HDAS (consecutive HDAS visits for longer than 2 months). Recurrent or Persistent HDAS patients were younger at diagnosis and more likely to experience renal or serositis manifestations; persistent HDAS patients were also more likely to experience neurological manifestations. Baseline SLEDAI greater than 10 was associated with longer HDAS episodes. Recurrent and Persistent HDAS were both associated with an increased likelihood of damage accrual. The total duration of HDAS episode greater than 2 years and experiencing multiple HDAS episodes (=4) was also associated with an increased likelihood of damage accrual (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.08-2.97, p = 0.02, and OR 3.31, 95% CI 1.66-13.26, p = 0.01, respectively).,HDAS episodes have a highly variable course.

              " 'This study focuses on the processes occurring during the acidogenic step of anaerobic digestion, especially resulting from nutritional interactions between dark fermentation (DF) bacteria and lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Previously, we have confirmed that DF microbial communities (MCs) that fed on molasses are able to convert lactate and acetate to butyrate. The aims of the study were to recognize the biodiversity of DF-MCs able and unable to convert lactate and acetate to butyrate and to define the conditions for the transformation.,MCs sampled from a DF bioreactor were grown anaerobically in mesophilic conditions on different media containing molasses or sucrose and/or lactate and acetate in five independent static batch experiments. The taxonomic composition (based on 16S_rRNA profiling) of each experimental MC was analysed in reference to its metabolites and pH of the digestive liquids. In the samples where the fermented media contained carbohydrates, the two main tendencies were observed: (i) a low pH (pH = 4), lactate and ethanol as the main fermentation products, MCs dominated with Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Leuconostoc and Fructobacillus was characterized by low biodiversity; (ii) pH in the range 5.0-6.0, butyrate dominated among the fermentation products, the MCs composed mainly of Clostridium (especially Clostridium_sensu_stricto_12), Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Prevotella. The biodiversity increased with the ability to convert acetate and lactate to butyrate. The MC processing exclusively lactate and acetate showed the highest biodiversity and was dominated by Clostridium (especially Clostridium_sensu_stricto_12). LAB were reduced; other genera such as Terrisporobacter, Lachnoclostridium, Paraclostridium or Sutterella were found. Butyrate was the main metabolite and pH was 7. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of the selected butyrate-producing MCs independently on the substrate revealed C.tyrobutyricum as the dominant Clostridium species. Functional analysis confirmed the presence of genes encoding key enzymes of the fermentation routes.,Batch tests revealed the dynamics of metabolic activity and composition of DF-MCs dependent on fermentation conditions. The balance between LAB and the butyrate producers and the pH values were shown to be the most relevant for the process of lactate and acetate conversion to butyrate. To close the knowledge gaps is to find signalling factors responsible for the metabolic shift of the DF-MCs towards lactate fermentation. Video Abstract.',\n",

In addition, neuropathic symptoms significantly improved at 2\\xa0weeks and were not present by 6\\xa0weeks. By 63\\xa0weeks, two of the patients reported continued complete pain relief, while one patient underwent total knee replacement due to an allergy of a previously implanted unicondylar implant.,This case series suggests that amniotic and umbilical cord particulate may be a viable alternative to reduce pain in patients with neuropathic pain.\",\n",
              " \"The interleukin-23p19-subunit inhibitor guselkumab effectively treats signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). We evaluated the effect of guselkumab on fatigue.,Across two phase 3 trials of guselkumab (DISCOVER-1, DISCOVER-2), patients with active PsA despite standard therapy were randomized to subcutaneous injections of guselkumab 100 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W, N = 373); guselkumab 100 mg at week 0, week 4, and then Q8W (N = 375); or placebo (N = 372) through week 24, after which patients in the placebo group crossed over to guselkumab Q4W. Fatigue was measured as a secondary endpoint using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue instrument (range 0-52, higher scores indicate less fatigue). Least-squares mean changes in FACIT-Fatigue scores were compared between treatments using a mixed-effect model for repeated measures. Mediation analysis was used to adjust for indirect effects on fatigue deriving from improvement in other outcomes, including =20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20; prespecified), minimal disease activity (MDA; post hoc), or C-reactive protein (CRP; post hoc).,Baseline mean (SD) FACIT-Fatigue scores in DISCOVER-1 (N = 381) and DISCOVER-2 (N = 739), ranging from 29.1 (9.5) to 31.4 (10.1), indicated substantial levels of fatigue relative to the United States general population (43.6 [9.4]). Across studies, mean improvements, and proportions of patients with =4-point improvements, in FACIT-Fatigue scores at week 24 with guselkumab Q4W and Q8W (5.6-7.6 and 54-63%, respectively) were larger vs placebo (2.2-3.6 and 35-46%). Improvement in FACIT-Fatigue scores with guselkumab was sustained from week 24 to week 52, with moderate-to-large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.52-0.81 at week 24; 0.66-0.91 at week 52). Mediation analyses demonstrated that substantial proportions of the effects of guselkumab vs placebo on fatigue were direct effect, after adjusting for achievement of ACR20 (Q4W 69-70%, Q8W 12-36% direct effect) or MDA (72-92% across dosing regimens) response or for change in serum CRP concentrations (82-88% across dosing regimens).,In patients with active PsA, guselkumab 100 mg Q4W or Q8W led to clinically meaningful and sustained improvements in fatigue through 1 year. A substantial portion of the improvement in FACIT-Fatigue scores induced by guselkumab was independent of effects on the achievement of other select outcomes.,Name of the registry: ClinicalTrials.gov Trial registrations: DISCOVER-1, NCT03162796; DISCOVER-2, NCT03158285 Date of registration: DISCOVER-1, May 22, 2017; DISCOVER-2, May 18, 2017 URLs of the trial registry record: DISCOVER-1, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03162796?term=NCT03162796&draw=1&rank=1 DISCOVER-2, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03158285?term=NCT03158285&draw=2&rank=1.\",\n",

Participants were all live-born singletons in Denmark during 1978-2012 (n = 2 069 785). Follow-up began at birth and continued until the onset of a psychiatric disorder, death, emigration or 31 December 2016, whichever came first. Cox proportional hazards model was employed to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) of psychiatric disorders.,Maternal migraine was associated with a 26% increased risk of any psychiatric disorders in offspring [HR, 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22-1.30]. Increased rates of psychiatric disorders were seen in all age groups from childhood to early adulthood. Increased rates were also observed for most of the specific psychiatric disorders, in particular, mood disorders (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.39-1.67), neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.37-1.52) and specific personality disorders (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.27-1.70), but not for intellectual disability (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71-1.00) or eating disorders (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.93-1.29). The highest risk was seen in the offspring of mothers with migraine and comorbid psychiatric disorders (HR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.99-2.28).,Maternal migraine was associated with increased risks of a broad spectrum of psychiatric disorders in offspring. Given the high prevalence of migraine, our findings highlight the importance of better management of maternal migraine at childbearing ages for early prevention of psychiatric disorders in offspring.',\n",

All original articles written in English evaluating the effects of abdominal obesity on pulmonary function in apparently healthy adults were eligible for this review.,A total of 26 studies (23 cross-sectional and three cohort) involving 68,024 participants were included in this review. More than 88% of the included studies reported that abdominal obesity significantly inversely was associated with pulmonary function.,The findings indicate that in subjects with abdominal obesity respiratory function decline possibly due to mechanical compression and obesity-induced airway inflammation. Therefore, nutrition and lifestyle interventions are required for the reduction of abdominal obesity that leads to improving pulmonary function and metabolic disease.',\n",

Following an MRI scan to investigate tremor in 2013, an incidental left anterior clinoid and right petrous meningioma were identified. Subtotal surgical resection was achieved for the anterior clinoid meningioma (WHO grade 1, meningothelial subtype). At follow-up in 2016, an olfactory groove meningioma and left greater wing of sphenoid meningioma were identified. By 2017, both tumours, along with the petrous meningioma, demonstrated significant growth. In 2018, clinical decline was evident and MRI demonstrated further tumour growth. Surgery was scheduled and the olfactory groove meningioma was completely resected (WHO grade 2, chordoid subtype). Hormones were stopped, after which regression of the petrous meningioma was observed. This case demonstrates an association between high-dose CPA and estradiol and the development, growth and regression of meningiomas in a transgender woman.',\n",

A 28-year-old previously healthy woman presented with multifocal pneumonia, mediastinal lymphadenopathy which was thought to be caused by actinomyces infection. Despite antibiotics, she developed cavitary lung lesions and had worsening lymphadenopathy prompting evaluation for alternative aetiologies like malignancy, autoimmune or immunodeficiency disorders. Further workup also revealed low CD4, CD8 cell counts, elevated soluble interleukin-2 levels. Over the due course of time, she developed granulomatous pan-uveitis, classical skin lesions leading to the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Our case highlights the rare manifestations of sarcoidosis which can mimic immunodeficiency disorders especially when these patients develop secondary infections. Our goal is to raise awareness among clinicians about these atypical presentations of sarcoidosis which can lead to substantial delay in diagnosis thus leading to progression of the disease in the absence of appropriate treatment.',\n",
              " 'The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 became a global pandemic in late 2019, and is still ongoing in 2021 causing significant morbidity and mortality. The advent of vaccinations heralded the turning of the tide. The Oxford jab, a vector-based vaccine was favoured due to its low cost and ease of storage. However, its potential association with thromboembolic adverse events resulted in controversy and disrupted its roll-out and use. The aetiopathogenesis of these thromboembolic events and its association with the Oxford vaccine are still speculative and uncertain, more so in the background of SARS-CoV-2 infection being highly thrombogenic in its own right. This paper presents a case of an otherwise healthy 50-year-old Caucasian man who developed acute abdominal pain 7 days following the first dose of Oxford vaccine and was found to have coeliac and splenic artery thrombosis complicated with splenic infarction.',\n",

Participants were followed prospectively at least every three years.,The main outcome was development of IBD, including Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Associations between ultra-processed food intake and risk of IBD were assessed using Cox proportional hazard multivariable models. Results are presented as hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals.,Participants were enrolled in the study between 2003 and 2016. During the median follow-up of 9.7 years (interquartile range 8.9-11.2 years), 467 participants developed incident IBD (90 with Crohn's disease and 377 with ulcerative colitis).

Electronic health records were linked with death data from the Office for National Statistics and hospital admission data from NHS Secondary Uses Service.,Adults (aged 16-105 years) and children (<16 years) from two cohorts: wave 1 (registered with a TPP practice as of 1 March 2020 and followed until 31 August 2020); and wave 2 (registered 1 September 2020 and followed until 8 February 2021). The main exposure group consisted of people on a general practice learning disability register; a subgroup was defined as those having profound or severe learning disability. People with Down's syndrome and cerebral palsy were identified (whether or not they were on the learning disability register).,Covid-19 related hospital admission and covid-19 related death. Non-covid-19 deaths were also explored.,For wave 1, 14 312 023 adults aged =16 years were included, and 90 307 (0.63%) were on the learning disability register. Among adults on the register, 538 (0.6%) had a covid-19 related hospital admission; there were 222 (0.25%) covid-19 related deaths and 602 (0.7%) non-covid deaths. Among adults not on the register, 29 781 (0.2%) had a covid-19 related hospital admission; there were 13 737 (0.1%) covid-19 related deaths and 69 837 (0.5%) non-covid deaths. Wave 1 hazard ratios for adults on the learning disability register (adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and geographical location) were 5.3 (95% confidence interval 4.9 to 5.8) for covid-19 related hospital admission and 8.2 (7.2 to 9.4) for covid-19 related death. Wave 2 produced similar estimates. Associations were stronger among those classified as having severe to profound learning disability, and among those in residential care. For both waves, Down's syndrome and cerebral palsy were associated with increased hazards for both events; Down's syndrome to a greater extent. Hazard ratios for non-covid deaths followed similar patterns with weaker associations. Similar patterns of increased relative risk were seen for children, but covid-19 related deaths and hospital admissions were rare, reflecting low event rates among children.,People with learning disability have markedly increased risks of hospital admission and death from covid-19, over and above the risks observed for non-covid causes of death. Prompt access to covid-19 testing and healthcare is warranted for this vulnerable group, and prioritisation for covid-19 vaccination and other targeted preventive measures should be considered.\",\n",
              " 'Some CXC chemokines, including CXCL14, transport CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) into dendritic cells (DCs), thereby activating TLR9. The molecular basis of this noncanonical function of CXC chemokines is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the CpG ODN binding and intracellular transport activities of various CXC chemokines and partial peptides of CXCL14 in mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. CXCL14, CXCL4, and CXCL12 specifically bound CpG ODN, but CXCL12 failed to transport it into cells at low dose. CXCL14 N-terminal peptides 1-47, but not 1-40, was capable of transporting CpG ODN into the cell, resulting in an increase in cytokine production. However, both the 1-47 and 1-40 peptides bound CpG ODN. By contrast, CXCL14 peptides 13-50 did not possess CpG ODN binding capacity or transport activity. The chimeric peptides CXCL12 (1-22)-CXCL14 (13-47) bound CpG ODN but failed to transport it. These results suggest that amino acids 1-12 and 41-47 of CXCL14 are required for binding and intracellular transport of CpG ODN, respectively. We found that an anti-CXCL14 Ab blocked cell-surface binding and internalization of the CpG ODN/CXCL14 complex. On the basis of these findings, we propose that CXCL14 has two functional domains, one involved in DNA recognition and the other in internalization of CXCL14-CpG DNA complex via an unidentified CXCL14 receptor, which together are responsible for eliciting the CXCL14/CpG ODN-mediated TLR9 activation. These domains could play roles in CXCL14-related diseases such as arthritis, obesity-induced diabetes, and various types of carcinoma.',\n",

We are investigating low-dose molecular targeted radionuclide therapy (MTRT) as an immunomodulator in combination with in situ tumor vaccines and need to analyze radioactive samples from MTRT-treated mice using flow cytometry. Further, the sudden shutdown of core facilities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented work stoppage. In these and other research settings, a robust and reliable means of cryopreservation of immune samples is required. We evaluated different fixation and cryopreservation protocols of disaggregated tumor cells with the aim of identifying a protocol for subsequent flow cytometry of the thawed sample, which most accurately reflects the flow cytometric analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment of a freshly disaggregated and analyzed sample. Cohorts of C57BL/6 mice bearing B78 melanoma tumors were evaluated using dual lymphoid and myeloid immunophenotyping panels involving fixation and cryopreservation at three distinct points during the workflow. Results demonstrate that freezing samples after all staining and fixation are completed most accurately matches the results from noncryopreserved equivalent samples. We observed that cryopreservation of living, unfixed cells introduces a nonuniform alteration to PD1 expression. We confirm the utility of our cryopreservation protocol by comparing tumors treated with in situ tumor vaccines, analyzing both fresh and cryopreserved tumor samples with similar results. Last, we use this cryopreservation protocol with radioactive specimens to demonstrate potentially beneficial effector cell changes to the tumor immune microenvironment following administration of a novel MTRT in a dose- and time-dependent manner.',\n",

Importantly, admission decision making is not solely based on medical acuity or clinical algorithms, and patients without a definite medical need for admission are hospitalised when physicians believe a potential issue exists if discharged. In this way, factors such as homelessness, substance use disorder, frailty, etc, contribute to admission because they raise concern about patient safety and/or barriers to appropriate treatment. Physician decision making can be altered by activities such as care coordination, advocacy by the patient or surrogate, interactions with other physicians or a change in clinical trajectory.,The decision to admit ultimately remains a clinical determination constructed between physician and patient. Physicians use a holistic process that incorporates broad consideration of the patient's medical and social needs with emphasis on risk assessment; thus, any analysis of hospitalisation trends or efforts to impact such should seek to understand this individual-level decision making.\",\n",

For each criterion and each GP clinic, we calculated ratios between the observed PIM time and that predicted by multivariate Poisson regressions on the patients. The observed variation was measured as the 90th/10th percentile ratios of these ratios. The extent of expectable random variation was assessed as the 90th/10th percentile ratios in randomly sampled GP populations (ie, the sampled variation). The GP-related excess variation was calculated as the ratio between the observed variation and sampled variation. The linear correlation between the observed/expected ratio for each of the criteria and the observed/expected ratio of total PIM time (for each clinic) was measured by Pearson's rho.,Overall, 294 542 individuals were exposed to 1 44 117 years of PIMs. The two most prevalent PIMs were long-term use (>3 months) of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (51 074 years of PIMs) or benzodiazepines (48 723 years of PIMs). These two criteria showed considerable excess variation of 2.33 and 3.05, respectively; for total PIMs, this figure was 1.65. For more than half of the criteria, we observed a positive correlation between the specific PIM and the sum of remaining PIMs.,This study documents considerable variations in the prescribing practice of GPs for certain PIMs. These findings highlight a need for exploring the causal explanations for such variations, which could be markers of suboptimal GP-prescribing strategies.\",\n",

As a Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) driver project, our study will report on the characteristics and usability of the first nationwide eFI in Switzerland connecting all five Swiss University Hospitals' Geriatric Departments with a representative sample of patients aged 65 years and older admitted to acute care.,The study protocol was approved by the competent ethics committee of the Canton of Zurich (BASEC-ID 2019-00445). All acquired data will be handled according to SPHN's ethical framework for responsible data processing in personalised health research. Analyses will be performed within the secure BioMedIT environment, a national infrastructure to enable secure biomedical data processing, an integral part of SPHN.,NCT04516642.\",\n",

The analytic sample included 3040 adults aged 20-64 years who tried to lose weight in the past year.,Participants were grouped into five LTWL categories (<5%, 5%-9.9%, 10%-14.9%, 15%-19.9% and =20%). Lifestyle-related behaviours included the following: alcohol intake, physical activity, smoking, fast-food consumption, dietary quality (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)) and caloric intake. Multivariable regression was employed adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, household income and size, current body mass index and self-reported health status.,Individuals in the 15%-19.9% LTWL group differed significantly from the reference group (<5% LTWL) in their physical activity and dietary quality (HEI) but not caloric intake. Specifically, they had a higher HEI score (ß=3.19; 95% CI 0.39 to 5.99) and were more likely to meet physical activity guidelines (OR=1.99; 95% CI 1.11 to 3.55). In comparison, the =20% LTWL group was significantly more likely to smoke (OR=1.63; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.57) and to consume lower daily calories (ß=-202.91; 95% CI -345.57 to -60.25) than the reference group; however, dietary quality and physical activity did not significantly differ.,Among a national sample of adults, a higher level of LTWL success does not necessarily equate to healthy weight loss behaviours. Future research should attempt to design interventions aimed at facilitating weight loss success while encouraging healthy lifestyle behaviours.',\n",

Occupational therapists play a role in vocational rehabilitation of mental health service users (MHSUs) with the aim of optimising their work participation. It is advisable that occupational therapists providing vocational rehabilitation to MHSUs with chronic mental illness in mental healthcare settings are guided by a practice framework developed for that particular context. This scoping review aims to summarise existing evidence on vocational rehabilitation for MHSUs in low-income to upper-middle-income countries. The findings will inform subsequent phases of research undertaken to formulate a vocational rehabilitation practice framework for MHSUs in Namibia.,The scoping review will employ the five stage methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. This will be used in conjunction with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISM-ScR) and Joanna Briggs scoping review guidelines. MESH terms, Boolean operators and truncation strategies will be employed for a comprehensive article search in electronic scholarly databases. These databases will include PsycINFO, EBSCOhost, HINARI, Google scholar, Medline, CINAHL, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Science Direct and Wiley Online Library. Mendeley and Rayyan, both open source platforms, will be used for title, abstract and full-text screening, as well as data extraction. Data will be sifted and sorted by key categories and themes using a data charting form.,The scoping review findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at local and international conferences.

The online survey was performed between 11 May and 12 May 2020, in the final phase of the state of emergency.,Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6) RESULTS: We found that male sex (95% CI 1.60 to 1.98), middle age (95% CI 1.55 to 1.93) and lower income (eg, annual household income <2.0 million: 95% CI 2.29 to 3.54) predicted social isolation; being a student was a protective factor against social isolation (95% CI 0.26 to 0.62). In the comparisons of each item of the LSNS-6 by sociodemographic characteristics, men were more likely to have fewer people to talk to about their personal problems (95% CI -0.37 to -0.28) and to seek help from (95% CI -0.39 to -0.30), and the middle-aged group had a lower social network of friends. Additionally, social isolation was associated with decreased online interaction with familiar people (95% CI -1.28 to -1.13) and decreased optimistic thinking under mild lockdown (95% CI -0.97 to -0.86).,We identified the sociodemographic and psychological characteristics associated with social isolation under mild lockdown.

Early interventions in preclinical stages could prevent or minimise the progression towards irreversible joint damage. The SCREEN-RA cohort (Evaluation of a SCREENing strategy for Rheumatoid Arthritis) aims to characterise the preclinical stages of the disease, to identify environmental risk factors, and to discover or validate novel biomarkers predictive for RA development.,SCREEN-RA includes an at-risk population for RA, namely first-degree relatives of patients with established RA.,The cohort started in 2009 is composed of mostly asymptomatic healthy individuals (total n=1458, 7262 person-years), with a mean age of 44 years at enrolment, 74% female and 91% Caucasian ethnicity. During the study period, 16 participants have developed RA. All participants provide baseline serum, DNA and RNA samples, and in a subset, stool samples and oral examination are performed for microbiota assessment. At enrolment, 10% of participants had asymptomatic autoimmunity associated with RA (n=147), 10% presented 'clinically suspect arthralgias' (n=143) and 3% reported arthralgias in conjunction with autoimmunity or high genetic risk (n=51). Studies with this cohort have uncovered risk factors for RA development, such as female hormonal factors, poor oral health or intestinal dysbiosis.,Future directions include immunological and 'multiomics' approaches to discover new biological markers of progression towards RA, as well as testing preventive interventions in 'high-risk' population.\",\n",

Secondary objectives were to determine the prevalence of subjective functional loss and severe disability at D30 and their associated factors.,Collected data included symptoms, nutritional status, self-evaluation of food intake, Performance Status (PS) Scale, Asthenia Scale, self-evaluation of strength (SES) for arms and legs at discharge and at D30. An SES <7 was used to determine subjective functional loss. A composite criteria for severe disability was elaborated combining malnutrition, subjective functional loss and PS >2. Patients were classified into three groups according to change in nutritional status between discharge and D30 (persistent malnutrition, correction of malnutrition and the absence of malnutrition).,Of 549 consecutive patients hospitalised for COVID-19 between 1 March and 29 April 2020, 130 died including 17 after discharge (23.7%). At D30, 312 patients were at home, 288 (92.3%) of whom were interviewed. Of the latter, 33.3% were malnourished at discharge and still malnourished at D30, while 23.2% were malnourished at discharge but no longer malnourished at D30. The highest predictive factors of persistent malnutrition were intensive care unit (ICU) stay (OR=3.42, 95% CI: 2.04 to 5.75), subjective functional loss at discharge (OR=3.26, 95% CI: 1.75 to 6.08) and male sex (OR=2.39, 95% CI: 1.44 to 3.97). Subjective functional loss at discharge (76.8%) was the main predictive factor of subjective functional loss at D30 (26.3%) (OR=32.6, 95% CI: 4.36 to 244.0). Lastly, 8.3% had a severe disability, with a higher risk in patients requiring an ICU stay (OR=3.39, 95% CI: 1.43 to 8.06).,Patients who survived a severe form of COVID-19 had a high risk of persistent malnutrition, functional loss and severe disability at D30.

Nine focus groups (ranging from 5 to 18 participants in each focus group) were carried out with Gateway students from three consecutive cohorts at 2-3 points in their Gateway programme year.,Data were generated to determine what 'works' in the Gateway programme. Turning a realist lens on the data identified six inter-relating mechanisms which helped students see medicine as attainable and achievable and prepared them for the transition to medical school. These were academic confidence (M1); developing professional identity (M2); financial support/security (M3); supportive relationships with staff (M4) and peers (M5); and establishing a sense of belonging as a university student (M6).,By unpacking the 'black box' of a Gateway programme through realist evaluation, we have shown that such programmes are not solely about providing knowledge and skills but are rather much more complex in respect to how they work. Further work is needed to further test the mechanisms identified in our study in other contexts for theory development and to identify predictors of effectiveness in terms of students' preparedness to transition.\",\n",

Article types included primary research, reviews, editorials and commentaries.,Key data elements were whether the study topic was related to COVID-19 and names of the principal and the senior authors. A hierarchical approach was used to determine the likely gender of authors. Logistic regression assessed the association of study characteristics, including COVID-19 status, with authors' likely gender; this was quantified using adjusted ORs (aORs).,We included 2252 articles, of which 748 (33.2%) were COVID-19-related and 1504 (66.8%) covered other topics. A likely gender was determined for 2138 (94.9%) principal authors and 1890 (83.9%) senior authors. Men were significantly more likely to be both principal (1364 men; 63.8%) and senior (1332 men; 70.5%) authors.

Our inclusion criteria constituted completed phase I, II and III studies investigating drugs approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Overall, 127 articles were analysed.,During the 5 year interval from 2015 to 2020, significantly more drugs were approved after phase III, and occasionally after phase II, trials than between 2000 and 2005 (p=0.002). Furthermore, there was a significant time difference (p=0.00001) indicating an increasingly briefer time interval between the publication of phase I and phase III results in the last few years.,Due to novel therapeutic approaches, numerous new drugs in lung oncology were approved. This has improved symptoms and prognoses in patients with advanced lung cancer.

              " 'COPD is diagnosed and evaluated by pulmonary function testing (PFT). Chest computed tomography (CT) primarily serves a descriptive role for diagnosis and severity evaluation. CT densitometry-based emphysema quantification and lobar fissure integrity assessment are most commonly used, mainly for lung volume reduction purposes and scientific efforts.A shift towards a more quantitative role for CT to assess pulmonary function is a logical next step, since more, currently underutilised, information is present in CT images. For instance, lung volumes such as residual volume and total lung capacity can be extracted from CT; these are strongly correlated to lung volumes measured by PFT.This review assesses the current evidence for use of quantitative CT as a proxy for PFT in COPD and discusses challenges in the movement towards CT as a more quantitative modality in COPD diagnosis and evaluation. To better understand the relevance of the traditional PFT measurements and the role CT might play in the replacement of these parameters, COPD pathology and traditional PFT measurements are discussed.',\n",

Until recently, SCLC treatment remained relatively unchanged, with chemotherapy remaining the cornerstone of treatment. In this overview we will highlight the recent advances in the field of staging, surgery, radiotherapy and systemic treatment. Nevertheless, the prognosis remains dismal and there is a pressing need for new treatment options. We describe the progress that has been made in systemic treatment by repurposing existing drugs and the addition of targeted treatment. In recent years, immunotherapy entered the clinic with high expectations of its role in the treatment of SCLC. Unravelling of the genomic sequence revealed new possible targets that may act as biomarkers in future treatment of patients with SCLC. Hopefully, in the near future, we will be able to identify patients who may benefit from targeted therapy or immunotherapy to improve prognoses.',\n",

They had annual clinical evaluations to diagnose dementia and AD, and the deceased underwent neuropathologic examination. In analyses, we assessed the relation of baseline cognitive activity to age at diagnosis of incident AD dementia and to postmortem markers of AD and other dementias.,During a mean of 6.8 years of follow-up, 457 individuals were diagnosed with incident AD at a mean age of 88.6 (SD 6.4, range 64.1-106.5) years. In an extended accelerated failure time model, higher level of baseline cognitive activity (mean 3.2, SD 0.7) was associated with older age at AD dementia onset (estimate 0.026; 95% confidence interval 0.013-0.039). Low cognitive activity (score 2.1, 10th percentile) was associated with a mean onset age of 88.6 years compared to a mean onset age of 93.6 years associated with high cognitive activity (score 4.0, 90th percentile). Results were comparable in subsequent analyses that adjusted for potentially confounding factors. In 695 participants who died and underwent a neuropathologic examination, cognitive activity was unrelated to postmortem markers of AD and other dementias.,A cognitively active lifestyle in old age may delay the onset of dementia in AD by as much as 5 years.',\n",
              " 'Hearing loss is one of the most common symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) caused by vestibular schwannomas (VSs). Fibrosis in the VS tumor microenvironment (TME) is associated with hearing loss in patients with NF2. We hypothesized that reducing the fibrosis using losartan, an FDA-approved antihypertensive drug that blocks fibrotic and inflammatory signaling, could improve hearing. Using NF2 mouse models, we found that losartan treatment normalized the TME by (i) reducing neuroinflammatory IL-6/STAT3 signaling and preventing hearing loss, (ii) normalizing tumor vasculature and alleviating neuro-edema, and (iii) increasing oxygen delivery and enhancing efficacy of radiation therapy. In preparation to translate these exciting findings into the clinic, we used patient samples and data and demonstrated that IL-6/STAT3 signaling inversely associated with hearing function, that elevated production of tumor-derived IL-6 was associated with reduced viability of cochlear sensory cells and neurons in ex vivo organotypic cochlear cultures, and that patients receiving angiotensin receptor blockers have no progression in VS-induced hearing loss compared with patients on other or no antihypertensives based on a retrospective analysis of patients with VS and hypertension. Our study provides the rationale and critical data for a prospective clinical trial of losartan in patients with VS.',\n",
              " 'Although substantial progress has been made with Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine measures, the immune correlates of vaccine-mediated protection remain uncertain. Here, five mucosal vaccine vectors based on human and avian paramyxoviruses provided nonhuman primates with varying degrees of protection, despite expressing the same EBOV glycoprotein (GP) immunogen. Each vaccine produced antibody responses that differed in Fc-mediated functions and isotype composition, as well as in magnitude and coverage toward GP and its conformational and linear epitopes. Differences in the degree of protection and comprehensive characterization of the response afforded the opportunity to identify which features and functions were elevated in survivors and could therefore serve as vaccine correlates of protection. Pairwise network correlation analysis of 139 immune- and vaccine-related parameters was performed to demonstrate relationships with survival. Total GP-specific antibodies, as measured by biolayer interferometry, but not neutralizing IgG or IgA titers, correlated with survival. Fc-mediated functions and the amount of receptor binding domain antibodies were associated with improved survival outcomes, alluding to the protective mechanisms of these vaccines. Therefore, functional qualities of the antibody response, particularly Fc-mediated effects and GP specificity, rather than simply magnitude of the response, appear central to vaccine-induced protection against EBOV. The heterogeneity of the response profile between the vaccines indicates that each vaccine likely exhibits its own protective signature and the requirements for an efficacious EBOV vaccine are complex.',\n",

The plastome structure in the Hoya group is characterised by a massive increase in the size of the inverted repeats as compared to the outgroups. In all ingroup species, the IR/SSC boundary moved from ycf1 to ndhF while this was not observed in outgroup taxa, making it a synapomorphy for the Hoya group. We have also assembled the mitogenome of Hoya lithophytica, which, at 718,734\\xa0bp, is the longest reported in the family. The phylogenetic analysis using exons from 42 taxa in the Hoya group and three outgoups confirms that the earliest divergent genus in the Hoya group is Papuahoya, followed by Dischidia. The relationship between Dischidia and the clade which includes all Hoya and Oreosparte taxa, is not fully supported. Oreosparte is nested in Hoya making it paraphyletic unless Clemensiella is recognised as a separate genus.',\n",
              " \"Cervical cancer affects more than 0.5 million women annually causing more than 0.3 million deaths. Detection of cancer in its early stages is of prime importance for eradicating the disease from the patient's body. However, regular population-wise screening of cancer is limited by its expensive and labour intensive detection process, where clinicians need to classify individual cells from a stained slide consisting of more than 100,000 cervical cells, for malignancy detection. Thus, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems are used as a viable alternative for easy and fast detection of cancer. In this paper, we develop such a method where we form an ensemble-based classification model using three Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, namely Inception v3, Xception and DenseNet-169 pre-trained on ImageNet dataset for Pap stained single cell and whole-slide image classification. The proposed ensemble scheme uses a fuzzy rank-based fusion of classifiers by considering two non-linear functions on the decision scores generated by said base learners. Unlike the simple fusion schemes that exist in the literature, the proposed ensemble technique makes the final predictions on the test samples by taking into consideration the confidence in the predictions of the base classifiers. The proposed model has been evaluated on two publicly available benchmark datasets, namely, the SIPaKMeD Pap Smear dataset and the Mendeley Liquid Based Cytology (LBC) dataset, using a 5-fold cross-validation scheme. On the SIPaKMeD Pap Smear dataset, the proposed framework achieves a classification accuracy of 98.55% and sensitivity of 98.52% in its 2-class setting, and 95.43% accuracy and 98.52% sensitivity in its 5-class setting. On the Mendeley LBC dataset, the accuracy achieved is 99.23% and sensitivity of 99.23%. The results obtained outperform many of the state-of-the-art models, thereby justifying the effectiveness of the same. The relevant codes of this proposed model are publicly available on GitHub .\",\n",
              " 'SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) hospitalizations and deaths disportionally affect males and older ages. Here we investigated the impact of male sex and age comparing sex-matched or age-matched ferrets infected with SARS-CoV-2. Differences in temperature regulation was identified for male ferrets which was accompanied by prolonged viral replication in the upper respiratory tract after infection. Gene expression analysis of the nasal turbinates indicated that 1-year-old female ferrets had significant increases in interferon response genes post infection which were delayed in males. These results provide insight into COVID-19 and suggests that older males may play a role in viral transmission due to decreased antiviral responses.',\n",
              " 'Whereas accelerated attention beclouded early stages of the coronavirus spread, knowledge of actual pathogenicity and origin of possible sub-strains remained unclear. By harvesting the Global initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database ( https://www.gisaid.org/ ), between December 2019 and January 15, 2021, a total of 8864 human SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences processed by gender, across 6 continents (88 countries) of the world, Antarctica exempt, were analyzed. We hypothesized that data speak for itself and can discern true and explainable patterns of the disease. Identical genome diversity and pattern correlates analysis performed using a hybrid of biotechnology and machine learning methods corroborate the emergence of inter- and intra- SARS-CoV-2 sub-strains transmission and sustain an increase in sub-strains within the various continents, with nucleotide mutations dynamically varying between individuals in close association with the virus as it adapts to its host/environment. Interestingly, some viral sub-strain patterns progressively transformed into new sub-strain clusters indicating varying amino acid, and strong nucleotide association derived from same lineage. A novel cognitive approach to knowledge mining helped the discovery of transmission routes and seamless contact tracing protocol. Our classification results were better than state-of-the-art methods, indicating a more robust system for predicting emerging or new viral sub-strain(s). The results therefore offer explanations for the growing concerns about the virus and its next wave(s). A future direction of this work is a defuzzification of confusable pattern clusters for precise intra-country SARS-CoV-2 sub-strains analytics.',\n",
              " \"To determine whether measurements of Endothelium/Descemet complex thickness (En/DMT) are of predictive value for corneal graft rejection after high-risk corneal transplantation, we conducted this prospective, single-center, observational case series\\xa0including\\xa0sixty eyes (60 patients) at high risk for corneal graft rejection (GR) because of previous immunologic graft failure or having at least two quadrants of stromal vascularization. Patients underwent corneal transplant. At 1st, 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th postoperative month, HD-OCT imaging of the cornea was performed, and the corneal status was determined clinically at each visit by a masked cornea specialist. Custom-built segmentation tomography algorithm was used to measure the central En/DMT. Relationships between baseline factors and En/DMT were explored. Time dependent covariate Cox survival regression was used to assess the effect of post-operative En/DMT changes during follow up. A longitudinal repeated measures model was used to assess the relationship between En/DMT and graft status. Outcome measures included\\xa0graft rejection, central Endothelium/Descemet's complex thickness, and\\xa0central corneal thickness (CCT). In patients with GR (35%), the central En/DMT increased significantly 5.3\\xa0months (95% CI: 2, 11) prior to the clinical diagnosis of GR, while it remained stable in patients without GR. During the 1-year follow up, the rejected grafts have higher mean pre-rejection En/DMTs (p = 0.01), compared to CCTs (p = 0.7). For En/DMT = 18\\xa0µm cut-off (at any pre-rejection visit), the Cox proportional hazard ratio was 6.89 (95% CI: 2.03, 23.4; p = 0.002), and it increased to 9.91 (95% CI: 3.32, 29.6; p < 0.001) with a = 19\\xa0µm cut-off. In high-risk corneal transplants, the increase in En/DMT allowed predicting rejection prior to the clinical diagnosis.\",\n",
              " 'The histological distinction between acute and chronic liver injury is a challenging aspect of liver histopathology. It is traditionally based on the interpretation of morphological changes to the extracellular matrix (ECM) at sites of hepatocyte loss using histochemical stains. Our aim was to investigate whether immunohistochemistry and multiplexing for collagen type (I & III) and elastic fibres and a modified Victoria blue method could be helpful. We studied 43 livers removed at transplantation for acute liver failure (ALF, 20 cases) or cirrhosis (23) plus 8 normal controls. In ALF the periportal ECM was normal in 2 cases, contained mainly collagen I associated with a ductular reaction in 6 cases, and delicate elastic strands in 11 cases. Periportal deposition of mainly collagen I and mature elastic fibres was observed in cirrhosis. In ALF the perisinusoidal ECM was intact in 4 cases, collapsed or condensed but of normal composition (predominantly collagen III) in 2 cases, and collapsed and condensed containing mostly collagen I in 17 cases (7 including delicate immature elastic strands). In contrast, bridging fibrous septa of cirrhosis contained abundant collagen 1 and bundles of mature elastin. We propose the use of a scale and the use of immunohistochemistry and multiplexing in additional to histochemical stains to characterise the ECM changes in acute and chronic liver injury.',\n",

In this retrospective clinical study, we examined differences in histopathologic features in paired liver biopsies collected from the same patient before and after DAA and correlated these findings with clinical outcome. Biopsies (n = 19) were evaluated by quantitative imaging analysis to measure steatosis and fibrosis. Most patients had decreased steatosis in their post-treatment, follow-up biopsies. However, one patient had a striking increase in steatosis (from 0.86 to 6.32%) and later developed decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This patient had a marked increase in fibrosis between biopsies, with a CPA of 6.74 to 32.02. Another patient, who already had bridging fibrosis at the time of her pre-treatment biopsy, developed cholangiocarcinoma after DAA. Even though the overall inflammatory activity in the post-treatment biopsies significantly decreased after treatment, 60% of patients had persistent portal lymphocytic inflammation. In summary, DAAs decreased steatosis and hepatic inflammation in most patients, although some may have persistence of lymphocytic portal inflammation. Patients known to have advanced fibrosis at treatment initiation and who have other risk factors for ongoing liver injury, such as steatosis, should be followed closely for the development of adverse outcomes, such as portal hypertension and primary liver cancers.',\n",

This is a cross-sectional study using data obtained from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) to investigate the health and nutritional status of Korean people, conducted in 2013, 2014, and 2015. The total of 8,473 patients included in the analysis. A 357 (19.34%) subjects in the chronic LBP group and 1,697 (25.61%) subjects in the no chronic LBP group reported no stress (P < 0.001). The numbers of subjects reporting mild, moderate, and severe stress in the two groups were 934 (50.6%) vs. 3,785 (57.11%), 432 (23.4%) vs. 910 (13.73%), and 123 (6.66%) and 235 (3.55%), respectively (all P < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis with full adjustment for other variables indicated higher OR for severe stress (OR 2.82, P < 0.001) than moderate (OR 2.54, P < 0.001) and mild (OR 1.55, P < 0.001) stress. We confirmed that there was a significant association between chronic LBP and degree of stress. Therefore, the degree of stress should be assessed in clinical treatment of chronic LBP patients.',\n",
              " 'Kluyveromyces marxianus is a yeast that could be identified from kefir and can use a broad range of substrates, such as glucose and lactate, as carbon sources. The lactate produced in kefir culture can be a substrate for K. marxianus. However, the complexity of the kefir microbiota makes the traits of K. marxianus difficult to study. In this research, we focused on K. marxianus cultured with lactate as the sole carbon source. The optimal growth and released protein in lactate culture were determined under different pH conditions, and the LC-MS/MS-identified proteins were associated with the tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis pathway, and cellular stress responses in cells, indicating that autolysis of K. marxianus had occurred under the culture conditions. The abundant glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GAP1) was cocrystallized with other proteins in the cell-free fraction, and the low transcription level of the GAP1 gene indicated that the protein abundance under autolysis conditions was dependent on protein stability. These results suggest that lactate induces the growth and autolysis of K. marxianus, releasing proteins and peptides. These findings can be fundamental for K. marxianus probiotic and kefir studies in the future.',\n",
              " 'This study was aimed at establishing the subcorticals substrates of the cognitive and visceromotor circuits of the A32 and A25 cortices of the medial prefrontal cortex and their projections and interactions with subcortical complexes in the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus). The study was primarily restricted to the nuclei of the diencephalon and amygdala. The common marmoset is a neotropical primate of the new world, and the absence of telencephalic gyrus favors the mapping of neuronal fibers. The biotinylated dextran amine was employed as an anterograde tracer. There was an evident pattern of rostrocaudal distribution of fibers within the subcortical nuclei, with medial orientation. Considering this distribution, fibers originating from the A25 cortex were found to be more clustered in the diencephalon and amygdala than those originating in the A32 cortex. Most areas of the amygdala received fibers from both cortices. In the diencephalon, all regions received projections from the A32, while the A25 fibers were restricted to the thalamus, hypothalamus, and epithalamus at different densities. Precise deposits of neuronal tracers provided here may significantly contribute to expand our understanding of specific connectivity among the medial prefrontal cortex with limbic regions and diencephalic areas, key elements to the viscerocognitive process.',\n",

The aim of this study was to compare the differences of quality of life (QoL) related to foot health in people with and without the presence of foot problems. A case-control study was carried out in an outpatient centre, where a clinician recorded data related to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. In addition, self-reported data on foot health-related quality of life were recorded using the Spanish version of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire. The sample consisted of 498 participants (249 cases and 249 controls), with a median age of 30\\xa0years and an interquartile range of 23\\xa0years. The differences between the groups were statistically significant for gender, age, footwear, general health, foot health, and physical activity. Cases showed lower scores for the domain of footwear, physical activity and vitality compared to controls. Foot pathologies have a negative impact on quality of life related to foot health, and the domains of footwear, general health and physical activity seem to be the factors that are associated with the presence of alterations and foot deformities.',\n",
              " 'HIV/SIV infections lead to massive loss of mucosal CD4 + T cells and breakdown of the epithelial mucosa resulting in severe microbial dysbiosis and chronic immune activation that ultimately drive disease progression. Moreover, disruption of one of the most understudied mucosal environments, the oral cavity, during HIV-induced immunosuppression results in significant microbial and neoplastic co-morbidities and contributes to and predicts distal disease complications. In this study we evaluated the effects of oral probiotic supplementation (PBX), which can stimulate and augment inflammatory or anti-inflammatory pathways, on early SIV infection of rhesus macaques. Our study revealed that similar to the GI mucosae, oral CD4 + T cells were rapidly depleted, and as one of the first comprehensive analyses of the oral microflora in SIV infection, we also observed significant modulation among two genera, Porphyromonas and Actinobacillus, early after infection. Interestingly, although PBX therapy did not substantially protect against oral dysbiosis or ameliorate cell loss, it did somewhat dampen inflammation and T cell activation. Collectively, these data provide one of the most comprehensive evaluations of SIV-induced changes in oral microbiome and CD4 + T cell populations, and also suggest that oral PBX may have some anti-inflammatory properties in lentivirus infections.',\n",

Individuals genetically susceptible to the carcinogenic effect of alcohol might have higher pancreatic cancer risk after drinking alcohol. The current study investigated the association between alcohol use and pancreatic cancer with 419 pancreatic cancer cases and 963 controls recruited by a hospital-based case-control study in Taiwan. Gene-environment interaction between alcohol use and polymorphisms of two ethanol-metabolizing genes, ADH1B and ALDH2, on pancreatic risk was evaluated. Our results showed no significant association between alcohol drinking and an increased pancreatic cancer risk, even at high levels of alcohol consumption. Even among those genetically susceptible to the carcinogenic effect of alcohol (carriers of ADH1B*2/*2(fast activity) combined with ALDH2*1/*2(slow activity) or ALDH2*2/*2(almost non-functional)), no significant association between alcohol use and pancreatic cancer was observed. Overall, our results suggested that alcohol drinking is not a significant contributor to the occurrence of pancreatic cancer in Taiwan.',\n",
              " \"Understanding the processes that shape biodiversity is essential for effective environmental management. Across the world's coral reefs, algal farming damselfish (Stegastes sp.) modify the surrounding benthic community through their creation of algae farms. Using a long-term monitoring dataset (2005-2019) from Moorea Island, French Polynesia, we investigated whether the density of dusky damselfish (Stegastes nigricans) is associated with benthic habitat composition, the density of predators and/or competitors, and whether the survey area was inside or outside of a Marine Protected Area (MPA). We found no evidence that benthic cover or number of competitors were associated with dusky damselfish densities, both inside and outside MPAs. In contrast, fluctuations in dusky damselfish densities were negatively associated with the density of predators (e.g. Serranidae, Muraenidae and Scorpaenidae) in the preceding year in non-MPA areas, and both within and outside of MPAs when predator densities were high (2005-2010). These results suggest that healthy predator populations may be important for regulating the abundances of keystone species, such as algal farming damselfish, especially when predator densities are high.\",\n",

To evaluate recombinant growth hormone (rGH) long-term response and retesting results in three different groups of children divided in accordance with the biochemical criteria of initial diagnosis. Height gain (?HT) at adult height (AH) and retesting results were evaluated in 57 rGH treated children (M = 34, 59.6%) divided into 3 groups according to initial diagnosis: Group A (n = 25) with max GH peak at stimulation test < 8\\xa0µg/L, Group B (n = 19) between 8 and 10\\xa0µg/L and Group C (n = 13) with mean overnight GH < 3\\xa0µg/L (neurosecretory dysfunction, NSD). Retesting was carried out in all patients after at least one month off therapy upon reaching the AH. 40/57 (70.2%) patients were pre-pubertal at diagnosis and showed ?HT of 1.37 ± 1.00 SDS, with no significant differences between groups (P = 0.08). Nonetheless, 46% patients in Group B showed ?HT < 1SDS (vs 13% and 12% in Group A and C, respectively) and 25% children failed to reach mid-parental height (vs 6% and 0% in Group A and C, respectively). At AH attainment, IGHD was reconfirmed in 28% (7/25) and 10% (2/19) in Group A and B, respectively. A reduction of diagnostic cut-off at GH stimulation tests could better discriminate between good and poor responders and predict the persistence of IGHD through transition. Group C response and the predictive value of baseline IGF-I SDS bring back to light NSD: should we consider an underlying hypothalamic derangement when the clinical presentation is strongly consistent with IGHD but pharmacological stimulation test is normal?',\n",

Alternative immune-based and molecular approaches have been developed, but cannot discriminate between active TB (ATB) and latent TB (LTBI). Here, to identify biomarkers that can discriminate between ATB and LTBI/healthy individuals (HC), we profiled 116 serum samples (HC, LTBI and ATB) using a protein microarray containing 257 MTB secreted proteins, identifying 23 antibodies against MTB antigens that were present at significantly higher levels in patients with ATB than in those with LTBI and HC (Fold change > 1.2; p < 0.05). A 4-protein biomarker panel (Rv0934, Rv3881c, Rv1860 and Rv1827), optimized using SAM and ROC analysis, had a sensitivity of 67.3% and specificity of 91.2% for distinguishing ATB from LTBI, and 71.2% sensitivity and 96.3% specificity for distinguishing ATB from HC. Validation of the four candidate biomarkers in ELISA assays using 440 serum samples gave consistent results. The promising sensitivity and specificity of this biomarker panel suggest it merits further investigation for its potential as a diagnostic for discriminating between latent and active TB.',\n",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the gut microbiota and knee cartilage damage while controlling for adiposity, high fat diet, and joint injury using lipodystrophic (LD) mice. LD and littermate control (WT) mice were fed a high fat diet, chow diet, or were rescued with fat implantation, then challenged with destabilization of the medial meniscus surgery to induce osteoarthritis (OA). 16S rRNA sequencing was conducted on feces. MaAslin2 was used to determine associations between taxonomic relative abundance and OA severity. While serum LPS levels between groups were similar, synovial fluid LPS levels were increased in both limbs of HFD WT mice compared to all groups, except for fat transplanted animals. The Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio of the gut microbiota was significantly reduced in HFD and OA-rescued animals when compared to chow. Nine novel significant associations were found between gut microbiota taxa and OA severity. These findings suggest the presence of causal relationships the gut microbiome and cartilage health, independent of diet or adiposity, providing potential therapeutic targets through manipulation of the microbiome.',\n",

Since the mammalian cochlea has an unusually high density of similar neurons (type-II spiral ganglion neurons, SGNs), we hypothesise that their function may have been exploited for social bonding by co-opting head movements in response to music and other rhythmic movements of the head in social contexts. Music provides one of many cultural behavioural mechanisms for 'virtual grooming' in that it is used to trigger the endorphin system with many people simultaneously so as to bond both dyadic relationships and large groups.

Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to determine the association between early individual, family, community factors and BMI z-scores trajectories of children. We identified three trajectories for boys and girls, named Class 1 as not-overweight, Class 2 as persistent rapid descending but overweight during pre-school age, and Class 3 as rapid rising up to school age and then become-overweight class. Macrosomia (OR 1.772; 95% CI 1.188-2.644) and being a single child (OR 2.038; 95% CI 1.453-2.859) were more likely to belong in Class 3 among boys.

These bacteria reside inside a protective sheath which makes any curative treatment challenging. We propose an antibiotic-free strategy to disrupt the biofilm by engineered clustered carbon dot nanoparticles that function in the acidic environment of the biofilms. In vitro and ex vivo studies on the mature biofilms of Streptococcus mutans revealed >90% biofilm inhibition associated with the contact-mediated interaction of nanoparticles with the bacterial membrane, excessive reactive oxygen species generation, and DNA fragmentation. An in vivo examination showed that these nanoparticles could effectively suppress the growth of S. mutans.

Preoperative serum PTH, calcium, phosphorus and ALP concentrations, intraoperative serum PTH concentrations; and serum PTH, calcium, phosphorus and ALP concentrations of 24th hour after surgery were included to the study. Intraoperatively, 20 minutes after parathyroid gland removal, blood was drawn for PTH assay. The changes in PTH levels between preoperative and intraoperative serum samples were calculated in percentage (ioPTH%) and postoperative 6th month serum PTH and ALP concentrations were included in the study.,No significant differences were found by gender, BMI, elapsed period of dialysis treatment and preoperative laboratory values between Group 1 and Group 2. The meanage of Group 1 was 35 years which is lower than Group 2. With the second group, the mean decrease in PTH levels between intraoperative and preoperative serum samples (ioPTH%) was about 90%, which was higher than Group 1.,In conclusion, we believe that, to encounter fewer persistent SHPT cases, it is essential that surgeons monitor ioPTH concentration 20 minutes after gland removal and confirm a decrease of 90% or more in ioPTH concentration.

Serial changes in the frequency of subsequent outpatient visits to clinics or hospitals (excluding large hospitals) for chronic ambulatory care of epilepsy, migraine, Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 2020 were measured. As a result, since April 2020, the monthly outpatient visits for epilepsy, PD, and AD decreased slightly but significantly (approximately 0.90 in relative risk [RR]) but visits for migraine increased (RR = 1.15). Telephone visit was most frequently used in April-May, in less than 5% of monthly outpatient clinic visits for the examined neurological diseases. Outpatient visits for migraine treatment were more likely to be done by telephone than in case of other diseases (adjusted Odds ratio = 2.08). These results suggest that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on regular ambulatory care for several chronic neurological diseases yielded different effect depending on the disease, in terms of the frequency or type of outpatient visits.\",\n",

As of week 22 (June 6, 2021), there were 704 cumulative cases of seasonal influenza, 8,144 cumulative cases of chickenpox, 356 cumulative cases of mycoplasma pneumonia, and 45 cumulative cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis; these numbers were significantly lower than those last year, with 563,487 cumulative cases of seasonal influenza, 31,785 cumulative cases of chickenpox, 3,518 cumulative cases of mycoplasma pneumonia, and 250 cumulative cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis. Similarly, many infectious diseases transmitted by droplets or contact declined in other countries and areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. One can reasonably assume that various measures adopted to control the transmission of COVID-19 have played a role in reducing the spread of other infectious diseases, and especially those transmitted by droplets or contact. Extensive and thorough implementation of personal protective measures and behavioral changes may serve as a valuable reference when identifying ways to reduce the spread of infectious diseases transmitted by droplets or contact in the future.',\n",
              " 'Previous studies have modified microbial genomes by introducing gene cassettes containing selectable markers and homologous DNA fragments. However, this requires several steps including homologous recombination and excision of unnecessary DNA regions, such as selectable markers from the modified genome. Further, genomic manipulation often leaves scars and traces that interfere with downstream iterative genome engineering. A decade ago, the CRISPR/Cas system (also known as the bacterial adaptive immune system) revolutionized genome editing technology. Among the various CRISPR nucleases of numerous bacteria and archaea, the Cas9 and Cas12a (Cpf1) systems have been largely adopted for genome editing in all living organisms due to their simplicity, as they consist of a single polypeptide nuclease with a target-recognizing RNA. However, accurate and fine-tuned genome editing remains challenging due to mismatch tolerance and protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-dependent target recognition. Therefore, this review describes how to overcome the aforementioned hurdles, which especially affect genome editing in higher organisms. Additionally, the biological significance of CRISPR-mediated microbial genome editing is discussed, and future research and development directions are also proposed.',\n",
              " 'Many synthetic gene circuits are restricted to single-use applications or require iterative refinement for incorporation into complex systems. One example is the recombinase-based digitizer circuit, which has been used to improve weak or leaky biological signals. Here we present a workflow to quantitatively define digitizer performance and predict responses to different input signals. Using a combination of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and fold change (FC), we evaluate three small-molecule inducible digitizer designs demonstrating FC up to 508x and SNR up to 3.77 dB. To study their behavior further and improve modularity, we develop a mixed phenotypic/mechanistic model capable of predicting digitizer configurations that amplify a synNotch cell-to-cell communication signal (? SNR up to 2.8 dB). We hope the metrics and modeling approaches here will facilitate incorporation of these digitizers into other systems while providing an improved workflow for gene circuit characterization.',\n",

Inhibiting aberrant angiogenesis using anti-angiogenic therapy (AAT) has been successful in the clinical treatment of cancer and eye diseases. However, resistance to AAT inevitably occurs and its molecular basis remains poorly understood. Here, we uncover molecular modifiers of the blood endothelial cell (EC) response to a widely used AAT bevacizumab by performing a pooled genetic screen using three-dimensional microcarrier-based cell culture and CRISPR-Cas9. Functional inhibition of the epigenetic reader BET family of proteins BRD2/3/4 shows unexpected mitigating effects on EC survival and/or proliferation upon VEGFA blockade. Moreover, transcriptomic and pathway analyses reveal an interaction between epigenetic regulation and anti-angiogenesis, which may affect chromosomal structure and activity in ECs via the cell cycle regulator CDC25B phosphatase. Collectively, our findings provide insight into epigenetic regulation of the EC response to VEGFA blockade and may facilitate development of quality biomarkers and strategies for overcoming resistance to AAT.',\n",

We investigate how disparity of vertebral morphology varies along the axial column of mammalian carnivores\\xa0- a chain of 27 subunits\\xa0- and the extent to which morphological variation have been structured by evolutionary constraints and locomotory adaptation. We find that lumbars and posterior thoracics exhibit high individual disparity but low serial differentiation. They are pervasively recruited into locomotory functions and exhibit relaxed evolutionary constraint. More anterior vertebrae also show signals of locomotory adaptation, but nevertheless have low individual disparity and constrained patterns of evolution, characterised by low-dimensional shape changes. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the thoracolumbar region as an innovation enabling evolutionary versatility of mammalian locomotion. Moreover, they underscore the complexity of phenotypic macroevolution of multi-element systems and that the strength of ecomorphological signal does not have a predictable influence on macroevolutionary outcomes.',\n",

              " \"The rostral migratory stream (RMS) facilitates neuroblast migration from the subventricular zone to the olfactory bulb throughout adulthood. Brain lesions attract neuroblast migration out of the RMS, but resultant regeneration is insufficient. Increasing neuroblast migration into lesions has improved recovery in rodent studies. We previously developed techniques for fabricating an astrocyte-based Tissue-Engineered RMS (TE-RMS) intended to redirect endogenous neuroblasts into distal brain lesions for sustained neuronal replacement. Here, we demonstrate that astrocyte-like-cells can be derived from adult human gingiva mesenchymal stem cells and used for TE-RMS fabrication. We report that key proteins enriched in the RMS are enriched in TE-RMSs. Furthermore, the human TE-RMS facilitates directed migration of immature neurons in vitro. Finally, human TE-RMSs implanted in athymic rat brains redirect migration of neuroblasts out of the endogenous RMS. By emulating the brain's most efficient means for directing neuroblast migration, the TE-RMS offers a promising new approach to neuroregenerative medicine.\",\n",
              " 'Cryo-EM maps are valuable sources of information for protein structure modeling. However, due to the loss of contrast at high frequencies, they generally need to be post-processed to improve their interpretability. Most popular approaches, based on global B-factor correction, suffer from limitations. For instance, they ignore the heterogeneity in the map local quality that reconstructions tend to exhibit. Aiming to overcome these problems, we present DeepEMhancer, a deep learning approach designed to perform automatic post-processing of cryo-EM maps. Trained on a dataset of pairs of experimental maps and maps sharpened using their respective atomic models, DeepEMhancer has learned how to post-process experimental maps performing masking-like and sharpening-like operations in a single step. DeepEMhancer was evaluated on a testing set of 20 different experimental maps, showing its ability to reduce noise levels and obtain more detailed versions of the experimental maps. Additionally, we illustrated the benefits of DeepEMhancer on the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase.',\n",

However, climate change is expected to affect the species composition of forest ecosystems, lead to forest type transitions and trigger irrecoverable losses of habitat and biodiversity. Here, we investigate potential impacts of climate change on the environmental suitability of main plant functional types (PFTs) across Central America. Using a large database of occurrence records and physiological data, we classify tree species into trait-based groups and project their suitability under three representative concentration pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) with an ensemble of state-of-the-art correlative modelling methods. Our results forecast transitions from wet towards generalist or dry forest PFTs for large parts of the study region. Moreover, suitable area for wet-adapted PFTs is projected to latitudinally diverge and lose connectivity, while expected upslope shifts of montane species point to high risks of mountaintop extinction. These findings underline the urgent need to safeguard the connectivity of habitats through biological corridors and extend protected areas in the identified transition hotspots.',\n",

Research is focusing in particular on its infection mechanisms and on the associated-disease symptoms. Interestingly, this environmental pathogen directly affects the human chemosensory systems leading to anosmia and ageusia. Evidence for the presence of the cellular entry sites of the virus, the ACE2/TMPRSS2 proteins, has been reported in non-chemosensory cells in the rodent's nose and mouth, missing a direct correlation between the symptoms reported in patients and the observed direct viral infection in human sensory cells. Here, mapping the gene and protein expression of ACE2/TMPRSS2 in the mouse olfactory and gustatory cells, we precisely identify the virus target cells to be of basal and sensory origin and reveal the age-dependent appearance of viral entry-sites. Our results propose an alternative interpretation of the human viral-induced sensory symptoms and give investigative perspectives on animal models.\",\n",
              " 'The multi-step base excision repair (BER) pathway is initiated by a set of enzymes, known as DNA glycosylases, able to scan DNA and detect modified bases among a vast number of normal bases. While DNA glycosylases in the BER pathway generally bend the DNA and flip damaged bases into lesion specific pockets, the HEAT-like repeat DNA glycosylase AlkD detects and excises bases without sequestering the base from the DNA helix. We show by single-molecule tracking experiments that AlkD scans DNA without forming a stable interrogation complex. This contrasts with previously studied repair enzymes that need to flip bases into lesion-recognition pockets and form stable interrogation complexes. Moreover, we show by design of a loss-of-function mutant that the bimodality in scanning observed for the structural homologue AlkF is due to a key structural differentiator between AlkD and AlkF; a positively charged ß-hairpin able to protrude into the major groove of DNA.',\n",

This dogma, however, is challenged by rare cases of apparently reversed early lesion hypodensity after complete reperfusion. The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of reversible ischemic edema after endovascular treatment.,One hundred eighty-four patients with acute ischemic anterior circulation stroke were included after consecutive screening. Ischemic brain edema was determined with quantitative lesion net water uptake (NWU) in admission CT and follow-up CT based on CT densitometry, and ?NWU was calculated as the difference. The association of edema progression to imaging and clinical parameters was investigated. Clinical outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at day 90.,Although rare, lesion hypodensity considered to be representative of early infarct in acute stroke CT may be reversible after complete recanalization. Arrest of edema progression of acute brain infarct lesions may occur after successful rapid vessel recanalization, resulting in improved functional outcome. Future research is needed to investigate conditions in which early revascularization may halt or even reverse vasogenic edema of ischemic tissue.',\n",

Two neurologists identified the symptomatic or largest T2 lesion for each patient (index lesion). MRIs were then independently reviewed by 2 neuroradiologists blinded to diagnosis to determine resolution of T2 lesions by consensus. The index T2 lesion area was manually outlined acutely and at follow-up to assess variation in size.,The MRI T2 lesions in MOGAD resolve completely more often than in AQP4-IgG-NMOSD and MS. This has implications for diagnosis, monitoring disease activity, and clinical trial design, while also providing insight into pathogenesis of CNS demyelinating diseases.',\n",

However, variability and unpredictability in treatment outcome have been observed, and are thought to be driven by patient-specific biology and interactions of the patient's immune system with the tumor. Here we develop an integrative systems biology and machine learning approach, built around clinical data, to predict patient response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and to improve the response rate. Using this approach, we determine biomarkers of patient response and identify potential mechanisms of drug resistance. We develop systems biology informed neural networks (SBINN) to calculate patient-specific kinetic parameter values and to predict clinical outcome. We show how transfer learning can be leveraged with simulated clinical data to significantly improve the response prediction accuracy of the SBINN. Further, we identify novel drug combinations and optimize the treatment protocol for triple combination therapy consisting of IL-6 inhibition, recombinant IL-12, and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in order to maximize patient response. We also find unexpected differences in protein expression levels between response phenotypes which complement recent clinical findings. Our approach has the potential to aid in the development of targeted experiments for patient drug screening as well as identify novel therapeutic targets.\",\n",

But precise risk model for subclinical atherosclerosis in the CKD population is still lacking. The study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for screening subclinical atherosclerosis among CKD patients without dialysis.,A total of 1452 CKD stage 1-5 has been recruited in this cross-sectional study. Subclinical atherosclerosis was diagnosed with carotid ultrasonography. Patients were divided into the training set and validation set. The risk factors of atherosclerosis were identified by the training set and confirmed by the validation set. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and decision curve analyses (DCA) were executed to evaluate the accuracy of fitted logistic models in training and validation sets. Finally, a nomogram based on constructed logistic regression model in all participants was plotted.,A total of 669 (46.1%) patients were diagnosed with subclinical carotid atherosclerosis. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that males, age, hypertension, diabetes, CKD stages, calcium, platelet, and albumin were risk factors for atherosclerosis. The accuracy of fitted logistic models was evaluated by the area under the ROC curve (AUC), which showed good predictive accuracy in the training set (AUC=0.764 (95% Confidence interval (CI): 0.733-0.794) and validation set (AUC=0.808 (95% CI: 0.765-0.852).

Various studies have investigated methods to overcome these obstacles in MG treatment. In this review, we address difficulties in MG treatment and focus on promising polymeric local drug delivery systems. In contrast to most local delivery systems, which are directly implanted into the residual cavity after intratumoral injection or the surgical removal of a tumor, some rapidly developing and promising nanotechnological methods-including surface-decorated nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles, and focused ultrasound assist transport-are administered through (systemic) intravascular injection.

Some of the widely used serological testing techniques are enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA), chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). However, these tests are plagued with low sensitivity or specificity, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. We developed a serological test implementing flow-through dot-blot assay (FT-DBA) for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG detection, which provides enhanced sensitivity and specificity while being quick to perform and easy to use.,SARS-CoV-2 antigens were immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane to capture human IgG, which was then detected with anti-human IgG conjugated gold nanoparticle (hIgG-AuNP). A total of 181 samples were analyzed in-house. Within which 35 were further evaluated in US FDA-approved CLIA Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 assay. The positive panel consisted of RT-qPCR positive samples from patients with both <14 days and >14 days from the onset of clinical symptoms. The negative panel contained samples collected from the pre-pandemic era dengue patients and healthy donors during the pandemic. Moreover, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of FT-DBA were evaluated against RT-qPCR positive sera. However, the overall efficacies were assessed with sera that seroconverted against either nucleocapsid (NCP) or receptor-binding domain (RBD).,In-house ELISA selected a total of 81 true seropositive and 100 seronegative samples. The sensitivity of samples with <14 days using FT-DBA was 94.7%, increasing to 100% for samples >14 days. The overall detection sensitivity and specificity were 98.8% and 98%, respectively, whereas the overall PPV and NPV were 99.6% and 99%. Moreover, comparative analysis between in-house ELISA assays and FT-DBA revealed clinical agreement of Cohen's Kappa value of 0.944. The FT-DBA showed sensitivity and specificity of 100% when compared with commercial CLIA kits.,The assay can confirm past SARS-CoV-2 infection with high accuracy within 2 minutes compared to commercial CLIA or in-house ELISA. It can help track SARS-CoV-2 disease progression, population screening, and vaccination response. The ease of use of the assay without requiring any instruments while being semi-quantitative provides the avenue of its implementation in remote areas around the globe, where conventional serodiagnosis is not feasible.\",\n",

LAG3 (Lymphocyte Activating 3), also named CD233, serves as an alternative inhibitory receptor to be targeted in the clinic. The impacts of LAG3 on immune cell populations and coregulation of immune responses in breast cancer remain largely unknown. To characterize the role of LAG3 in breast cancer, we investigated transcriptome data and associated clinical information derived from 2,994 breast cancer patients. We estimated the landscape of the relationship between LAG3 and 10 types of cell populations of breast cancer. We investigated the correlation pattern between LAG3 and immune modulators in pancancer, particularly the synergistic role of LAG3 with other immune checkpoint members in breast cancer. LAG3 expression was closely related to the malignancy of breast cancer and may serve as a potential biomarker. LAG3 may play an important role in regulating the tumor immune microenvironment of T cells and other immune cells.

Understanding SpA pathogenesis has been proven challenging due to the limited availability of human target tissues. In recent years, the interleukin (IL)-23/IL-17 pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of SpA, in addition to the Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-a) cytokine. The underlying molecular mechanisms by which the IL-23/IL-17 pathway triggers disease initiation, both in the joints as well as at extra-musculoskeletal sites, are not precisely known. Animal models that resemble pathological features of human SpA have provided possibilities for in-depth molecular analyses of target tissues during various phases of the disease, including the pre-clinical initiation phase of the disease before arthritis and spondylitis are clinically present. Herein, we summarize recent insights gained in SpA animal models on the role of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway in immune activation across affected sites in SpA, which include the joint, entheses, gut and skin. We discuss how local activation of the IL-23/IL-17 axis may contribute to the development of tissue inflammation and the onset of clinically manifest SpA.

              " 'Allergic reactions to drugs and chemicals are mediated by an adaptive immune response involving specific T cells. During thymic selection, T cells that have not yet encountered their cognate antigen are considered naive T cells. Due to the artificial nature of drug/chemical-T-cell epitopes, it is not clear whether thymic selection of drug/chemical-specific T cells is a common phenomenon or remains limited to few donors or simply does not exist, suggesting T-cell receptor (TCR) cross-reactivity with other antigens. Selection of drug/chemical-specific T cells could be a relatively rare event accounting for the low occurrence of drug allergy. On the other hand, a large T-cell repertoire found in multiple donors would underline the potential of a drug/chemical to be recognized by many donors. Recent observations raise the hypothesis that not only the drug/chemical, but also parts of the haptenated protein or peptides may constitute the important structural determinants for antigen recognition by the TCR. These observations may also suggest that in the case of drug/chemical allergy, the T-cell repertoire results from particular properties of certain TCR to recognize hapten-modified peptides without need for previous thymic selection. The aim of this review is to address the existence and the role of a naive T-cell repertoire in drug and chemical allergy. Understanding this role has the potential to reveal efficient strategies not only for allergy diagnosis but also for prediction of the immunogenic potential of new chemicals.',\n",

Nanoparticle immunogens presenting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S) in repetitive arrays are being advanced as second-generation vaccine candidates, as they feature robust manufacturing characteristics and have shown promising immunogenicity in preclinical models. Here, we used previously reported deep mutational scanning (DMS) data to guide the design of stabilized variants of the RBD. The selected mutations fill a cavity in the RBD that has been identified as a linoleic acid binding pocket. Screening of several designs led to the selection of two lead candidates that expressed at higher yields than the wild-type RBD. These stabilized RBDs possess enhanced thermal stability and resistance to aggregation, particularly when incorporated into an icosahedral nanoparticle immunogen that maintained its integrity and antigenicity for 28 days at 35-40°C, while corresponding immunogens displaying the wild-type RBD experienced aggregation and loss of antigenicity. The stabilized immunogens preserved the potent immunogenicity of the original nanoparticle immunogen, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical trial. Our findings may improve the scalability and stability of RBD-based coronavirus vaccines in any format and more generally highlight the utility of comprehensive DMS data in guiding vaccine design.',\n",

The score varies from 0 (no conflict) to 100 (high conflict). Secondary outcomes were collected at 1 or 6 months: DCS, quality of life, illness perception, patient activation, patient perception of statin efficacy and shared decision-making, self-reported statin adherence, understanding of statin-therapy, post-randomisation low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and physician opinion of the intervention. Outcomes are reported as median (25th- 75th percentile).,Decisional conflict differed between the intervention arms: median control 27 (20-43), iAR-group 22 (11-30; p-value vs control 0.001) and iLE-group 25 (10-31; p-value vs control 0.021). No differences in secondary outcomes were observed.,In patients with clinically manifest CVD, providing personalised estimations of treatment-effects resulted in a small but significant decrease in decisional conflict after 1 month.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a widely available, daily medication efficacious in preventing HIV. Little is known about PrEP knowledge, acceptability, initiation and sustained use among CJ-involved persons or about how these outcomes vary by multilevel factors. The Southern Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Study (SPECS) will investigate barriers and facilitators for PrEP initiation and sustained use among CJ-involved adults, building a foundation for PrEP interventions for this underserved population.,SPECS uses a mixed-methods sequential design, including a multisite, prospective cohort study in three southern states-North Carolina, Florida and Kentucky-and subsequent qualitative interviews. HIV-negative adults clinically indicated for PrEP with CJ-involvement in the past year (n=660; 220 per site)-will be recruited for four quantitative interviews separated by 6 months, with 18 months of follow-up. Interviews will measure CJ involvement, substance use, sexual behaviours, PrEP acceptability and use, healthcare access and utilisation, support systems and psychological and emotional well-being. We will estimate probabilities of PrEP acceptability and use in a CJ-involved population using descriptive and multivariable analyses. After the follow-up, a subsample that never initiated PrEP, initiated but did not sustain PrEP or sustained PrEP will be asked to participate in a qualitative interview to contextualise their experiences and decisions around PrEP. An inductive approach will guide qualitative analyses.,PrEP initiation and sustained use rates are unknown among CJ-involved adults. This research will identify individual, social and structural factors that predict PrEP initiation and use.

Overall satisfaction with maternal healthcare was high. However, having a Norwegian partner, higher education and high Norwegian language comprehension were associated with greater odds of being dissatisfied with care. One-third of all women did not understand the information provided by the healthcare personnel during maternity care. More women with refugee background felt treated differently because of factors such as religion, language and skin colour, than women who migrated due to family reunification.,Although the overall satisfaction was high, for certain healthcare experiences such as understanding information, we found more negative responses.

While depression prevalence is high in people with dementia and psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) are effective, access to psychological interventions remains limited. Reliance on traditional CBT for people with dementia and depression may present difficulties given it is a complex psychological approach, costly to deliver, and professional training time is lengthy. An alternative approach is behavioural activation (BA), a simpler psychological intervention for depression. The present study seeks to work with people with dementia, informal caregivers, community stakeholders, and healthcare professionals, to adapt a guided low-intensity BA intervention for people with dementia and depression, while maximising implementation potential within the Swedish healthcare context.,A mixed methods study using codesign, principles from participatory action research (PAR) and normalisation process theory to facilitate the cultural relevance, appropriateness and implementation potential of the intervention.

Eight Nepalese nurses, one Nepalese student and three Norwegian students participated as raters.,The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), positive, negative, absolute agreement, Scott's pi and sum score were calculated using PIVC-miniQ. We also aimed to describe PIVC quality of care, as it is important to prevent PIVC-associated complications such as phlebitis or catheter-associated bloodstream infections.,A total of 390 patients (409 PIVCs) were included in the study. The ICC between raters was 0.716 for Nepalese raters, 0.644 for Norwegian raters and 0.481 for the pooled data. The most frequently observed problems associated with PIVCs were blood in the intravenous line (51.5%), pain and tenderness on palpation (43.4%), and fixation with opaque tape (38.5%). The average sum score was 3.32 deviations from best practice for PIVCs fixed with non-sterile opaque tape and 2.37 for those fixed with transparent dressing (p<0.001).,The PIVC-miniQ is a feasible and reliable tool for nurses assessing PIVC quality in hospitalised patients in Nepal.

Of these, 1030 were valid questionnaires, and the effective response rate was 85.83%. We collected demographic characteristics of our participants and administered the following scales to them: Workplace Violence, Trait Coping Style, Self-rating Anxiety. Data were statistically analysed.,The results showed that 67.28% of healthcare workers in county hospitals in China had experienced workplace violence in the previous 12 months, with prevalent verbal violence (66.12%) followed by physical violence (15.24%). Workplace violence in hospitals was negatively related to positive coping (r=-0.091, p<0.01) but positively related to negative coping (r=0.114, p<0.001) and anxiety (r=0.298, p<0.001). Positive and negative coping was negatively (r=-0.085, p<0.01) and positively (r=0.254, p<0.001) associated with anxiety respectively. Positive and negative coping influenced both hospital workplace violence and anxiety in healthcare workers who were victims of violence. Compared with positive coping, the mediating effect of negative coping was stronger (95% CI -0.177 to -0.006).,The incidence of workplace violence among healthcare workers in county-level hospitals in China is relatively high, and there is a correlation between hospital violence, coping styles and anxiety. Positive and negative coping play a mediating role in the impact of hospital violence on healthcare workers' anxiety. Therefore, hospital administrators should actively promote healthcare workers' transition to positive coping strategies and minimise the negative impact of anxiety on them.\",\n",

Three ad hoc phone surveys are administered to 600 heads of households, their housewives in charge of managing the household and a relative living temporarily in the household, respectively. In addition to sharing identical sets of questions on several topics (risks perceptions, attitudes to curfew, attitudes to vaccines, beliefs about COVID-19 infection), the three separate survey questionnaires also include other topics (economic impact, local preventive strategies) whose related questions differ between questionnaires. As analysing evolutions is the study's primary focus, data on all the topics covered will be collected in three waves unless the spread of COVID-19 by mid-2021 justifies extending data collection.

              " 'To evaluate the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 testing on shortening the duration of quarantines for COVID-19 and to identify the most effective choices of testing schedules.,We performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of quarantine strategies when one or more SARS-CoV-2 tests were administered during the quarantine. Simulations were based on statistical models for the transmissibility and viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the sensitivities of available testing methods. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of perturbations in model assumptions on the outcomes of optimal strategies.,We found that SARS-CoV-2 testing can effectively reduce the length of a quarantine without compromising safety. A single reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) test performed before the end of quarantine can reduce quarantine duration to 10 days. Two tests can reduce the duration to 8 days, and three highly sensitive RT-PCR tests can justify a 6-day quarantine. More strategic testing schedules and longer quarantines are needed if tests are administered with less-sensitive RT-PCR tests or antigen tests. Shorter quarantines can be used for applications that tolerate a residual postquarantine transmission risk comparable to a 10-day quarantine.,Testing could substantially reduce the length of isolation, reducing the physical and mental stress caused by lengthy quarantines. With increasing capacity and lowered costs of SARS-CoV-2 tests, test-assisted quarantines could be safer and more cost-effective than 14-day quarantines and warrant more widespread use.',\n",

              " 'Alphaherpesviruses are large dsDNA viruses with an ability to establish persistent infection in hosts, which rely partly on their ability to evade host innate immune responses, notably the type I IFN response. However, the relevant molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we report the UL42 proteins of alphaherpesvirus pseudorabies virus (PRV) and HSV type 1 (HSV1) as a potent antagonist of the IFN-I-induced JAK-STAT signaling pathway. We found that ectopic expression of UL42 in porcine macrophage CRL and human HeLa cells significantly suppresses IFN-a-mediated activation of the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE), leading to a decreased transcription and expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Mechanistically, UL42 directly interacts with ISRE and interferes with ISG factor 3 (ISGF3) from binding to ISRE for efficient gene transcription, and four conserved DNA-binding sites of UL42 are required for this interaction. The substitution of these DNA-binding sites with alanines results in reduced ISRE-binding ability of UL42 and impairs for PRV to evade the IFN response. Knockdown of UL42 in PRV remarkably attenuates the antagonism of virus to IFN in porcine kidney PK15 cells. Our results indicate that the UL42 protein of alphaherpesviruses possesses the ability to suppress IFN-I signaling by preventing the association of ISGF3 and ISRE, thereby contributing to immune evasion. This finding reveals UL42 as a potential antiviral target.',\n",
              " 'BACKGROUND Uveitis is a clinical condition characterized by acute blurry vision related to an inflammation of the uvea. Gut microbiome dysbiosis can influence the prognosis of uveitis by inducing a loss of intestinal immune homeostasis leading to a lower activation threshold of the immune cells. This promotes a pro-inflammatory response resulting in reactivation of the disease. This is the case report of a 21-year-old woman with a 3-year history of acute anterior uveitis (AAU) of the right eye, who responded favorably to probiotic dietary supplementation. CASE REPORT A 21-year-old woman, previously unknown to our Ophthalmology Unit, presented with ocular pain and redness. Three years ago, she had been diagnosed with monolateral AAU in the right eye. Her medical and family histories were unremarkable. After a complete clinical evaluation, we decided to start a combination treatment protocol with continuous use of probiotics and the use of ocular steroids only during an exacerbation of the condition. To monitor the trend of the disease, she underwent a monthly clinical examination for the following year. During this period, we observed a decrease in ocular inflammation with a gain in the primary outcome (best-corrected visual acuity), and the steroids and atropine were discontinued for the following months. CONCLUSIONS This case report describes a patient with a 3-year history of AAU, who responded well to a combination treatment of dietary probiotic supplementation and steroids, demonstrating that probiotics can reduce recurrences of AAU.',\n",

The protective capacity of MAIT cells has been demonstrated in murine models of local infection, including in the lungs. Here we show that during systemic infection of mice with Francisella tularensis live vaccine strain results in evident MAIT cell expansion in the liver, lungs, kidney and spleen and peripheral blood. The responding\\xa0MAIT cells manifest a polarised Th1-like MAIT-1 phenotype, including transcription factor and cytokine profile, and confer a critical role in controlling bacterial load. Post resolution of the primary infection, the expanded MAIT cells form stable memory-like MAIT-1 cell populations, suggesting a basis for vaccination. Indeed, a systemic vaccination with synthetic antigen 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-D-ribitylaminouracil in combination with CpG adjuvant similarly boosts MAIT cells, and results in enhanced protection against both systemic and local infections with different bacteria. Our study highlights the potential utility of targeting MAIT cells to combat a range of bacterial pathogens.',\n",
              " 'Metabolic programming and mitochondrial dynamics along with T cell differentiation affect T cell fate and memory development; however, how to control metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial dynamics in T cell memory development is unclear. Here, we provide evidence that the SUMO protease SENP1 promotes T cell memory development via Sirt3 deSUMOylation. SENP1-Sirt3 signalling augments the deacetylase activity of Sirt3, promoting both OXPHOS and mitochondrial fusion. Mechanistically, SENP1 activates Sirt3 deacetylase activity in T cell mitochondria, leading to reduction of the acetylation of mitochondrial metalloprotease YME1L1. Consequently, deacetylation of YME1L1 suppresses its activity on OPA1 cleavage to facilitate mitochondrial fusion, which results in T cell survival and promotes T cell memory development. We also show that the glycolytic intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) as a negative regulator suppresses AMPK-mediated activation of the SENP1-Sirt3 axis and reduces memory development. Moreover, glucose limitation reduces FBP production and activates AMPK during T cell memory development. These data show that glucose limitation activates AMPK and the subsequent SENP1-Sirt3 signalling for T cell memory development.',\n",

Here, we analyse data sampled in a large-scale manner from 379,875 people in the United Kingdom (UK) during 2020 to identify population variables associated with mood and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to investigate self-perceived pandemic impact in relation to those variables. We report that while there are relatively small population-level differences in mood assessment scores pre- to peak-UK lockdown, the size of the differences is larger for people from specific groups, e.g. older adults and people with lower incomes. Multiple dimensions underlie peoples' perceptions, both positive and negative, of the pandemic's impact on daily life. These dimensions explain variance in mental health and can be statistically predicted from age, demographics, home and work circumstances, pre-existing conditions, maladaptive technology use and personality traits (e.g., compulsivity). We conclude that a holistic view, incorporating the broad range of relevant population factors, can better characterise people whose mental health is most at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.\",\n",
              " 'DNMDP and related compounds, or velcrins, induce complex formation between the phosphodiesterase PDE3A and the SLFN12 protein, leading to a cytotoxic response in cancer cells that express elevated levels of both proteins. The mechanisms by which velcrins induce complex formation, and how the PDE3A-SLFN12 complex causes cancer cell death, are not fully understood. Here, we show that PDE3A and SLFN12 form a heterotetramer stabilized by binding of DNMDP. Interactions between the C-terminal alpha helix of SLFN12 and residues near the active site of PDE3A are required for complex formation, and are further stabilized by interactions between SLFN12 and DNMDP. Moreover, we demonstrate that SLFN12 is an RNase, that PDE3A binding increases SLFN12 RNase activity, and that SLFN12 RNase activity is required for DNMDP response. This new mechanistic understanding will facilitate development of velcrin compounds into new cancer therapies.',\n",

Nonsense suppression (also termed readthrough) therapy restores protein function by selectively suppressing translation termination at PTCs. Poor efficacy of current readthrough agents prompted us to search for better compounds. An NMD-sensitive NanoLuc readthrough reporter was used to screen 771,345 compounds. Among the 180 compounds identified with readthrough activity, SRI-37240 and its more potent derivative SRI-41315, induce a prolonged pause at stop codons and suppress PTCs associated with cystic fibrosis in immortalized and primary human bronchial epithelial cells, restoring CFTR expression and function. SRI-41315 suppresses PTCs by reducing the abundance of the termination factor eRF1. SRI-41315 also potentiates aminoglycoside-mediated readthrough, leading to synergistic increases in CFTR activity.

Here we show using single-cell RNA sequencing that intrarenal class-switched B cells have an innate cell transcriptional state resembling mouse peritoneal B1 or B-innate (Bin) cells. Antibodies generated by Bin cells do not bind donor-specific antigens nor are they enriched for reactivity to ubiquitously expressed self-antigens. Rather, Bin cells frequently express antibodies reactive with either renal-specific or inflammation-associated antigens. Furthermore, local antigens can drive Bin cell proliferation and differentiation into plasma cells expressing self-reactive antibodies. These data show a mechanism of human inflammation in which a breach in organ-restricted tolerance by infiltrating innate-like B cells drives local tissue destruction.',\n",

              " 'Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 spreads within the respiratory tract is important to define the parameters controlling the severity of COVID-19. Here we examine the functional and structural consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a reconstructed human bronchial epithelium model. SARS-CoV-2 replication causes a transient decrease in epithelial barrier function and disruption of tight junctions, though viral particle crossing remains limited. Rather, SARS-CoV-2 replication leads to a rapid loss of the ciliary layer, characterized at the ultrastructural level by axoneme loss and misorientation of remaining basal bodies. Downregulation of the master regulator of ciliogenesis Foxj1 occurs prior to extensive cilia loss, implicating this transcription factor in the dedifferentiation of ciliated cells. Motile cilia function is compromised by SARS-CoV-2 infection, as measured in a mucociliary clearance assay. Epithelial defense mechanisms, including basal cell mobilization and interferon-lambda induction, ramp up only after the initiation of cilia damage. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters further demonstrates the loss of motile cilia in vivo. This study identifies cilia damage as a pathogenic mechanism that could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 spread to the deeper lung parenchyma.',\n",

Fish harvest and biodiversity data remain largely disparate and severely deficient in many areas, which makes assessing and managing inland fisheries difficult. Expert knowledge is increasingly used to improve and inform biological or vulnerability assessments, especially in data-poor areas. Integrating expert knowledge on the distribution, intensity, and relative influence of human activities can guide natural resource management strategies and institutional resource allocation and prioritization. This paper introduces a dataset summarizing the expert-perceived state of inland fisheries at the basin (fishery) level. An electronic survey distributed to professional networks (June-September 2020) captured expert perceptions (n = 536) of threats, successes, and adaptive capacity to fisheries across 93 hydrological basins, 79 countries, and all major freshwater habitat types. This dataset can be used to address research questions with conservation relevance, including: demographic influences on perceptions of threat, adaptive capacities for climate change, external factors driving multi-stressor interactions, and geospatial threat assessments.',\n",
              " 'Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation is a central epigenetic modification that defines heterochromatin from unicellular to multicellular organisms. In mammalian cells, H3K9 methylation can be catalyzed by at least six distinct SET domain enzymes: Suv39h1/Suv39h2, Eset1/Eset2 and G9a/Glp. We used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with a conditional mutation for Eset1 and introduced progressive deletions for the other SET domain genes by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Compound mutant MEFs for all six SET domain lysine methyltransferase (KMT) genes lack all H3K9 methylation states, derepress nearly all families of repeat elements and display genomic instabilities. Strikingly, the 6KO H3K9 KMT MEF cells no longer maintain heterochromatin organization and have lost electron-dense heterochromatin. This is a compelling analysis of H3K9 methylation-deficient mammalian chromatin and reveals a definitive function for H3K9 methylation in protecting heterochromatin organization and genome integrity.',\n",

By GWAS meta-analysis for creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from the\\xa0Chronic Kidney Disease Genetics Consortium and UK Biobank (n = 1,201,909), we expand the number of eGFRcrea loci (424 loci, 201 novel; 9.8% eGFRcrea variance explained by 634 independent signal variants). Our increased sample size in fine-mapping (n = 1,004,040, European) more than doubles the number of signals with resolved fine-mapping (99% credible sets down to 1 variant for 44 signals, =5 variants for 138 signals). Cystatin-based eGFR and/or blood urea nitrogen association support 348 loci (n = 460,826 and 852,678, respectively). Our customizable tool for Gene PrioritiSation reveals 23 compelling genes including mechanistic insights and enables navigation through genes and variants likely relevant for kidney function in human to help select targets for experimental follow-up.',\n",
              " 'Bioproduction of renewable chemicals is considered as an urgent solution for fossil energy crisis. However, despite tremendous efforts, it is still challenging to generate microbial strains that can produce target biochemical to high levels. Here, we report an example of biosynthesis of high-value and easy-recoverable derivatives built upon natural microbial pathways, leading to improvement in bioproduction efficiency. By leveraging pathways in solventogenic clostridia for co-producing acyl-CoAs, acids and alcohols as precursors, through rational screening for host strains and enzymes, systematic metabolic engineering-including elimination of putative prophages, we develop strains that can produce 20.3 g/L butyl acetate and 1.6 g/L butyl butyrate. Techno-economic analysis results suggest the economic competitiveness of our developed bioprocess. Our principles of selecting the most appropriate host for specific bioproduction and engineering microbial chassis to produce high-value and easy-separable end products may be applicable to other bioprocesses.',\n",
              " 'The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates gene expression, governing aspects of homeostasis, but is also involved in cancer. Pharmacological GR activation is frequently used to alleviate therapy-related side-effects. While prior studies have shown GR activation might also have anti-proliferative action on tumours, the underpinnings of glucocorticoid action and its direct effectors in non-lymphoid solid cancers remain elusive. Here, we study the mechanisms of glucocorticoid response, focusing on lung cancer. We show that GR activation induces reversible cancer cell dormancy characterised by anticancer drug tolerance, and activation of growth factor survival signalling accompanied by vulnerability to inhibitors. GR-induced dormancy is dependent on a single GR-target gene, CDKN1C, regulated through chromatin looping of a GR-occupied upstream distal enhancer in a SWI/SNF-dependent fashion. These insights illustrate the importance of GR signalling in non-lymphoid solid cancer biology, particularly in lung cancer, and warrant caution for use of glucocorticoids in treatment of anticancer therapy related side-effects.',\n",
              " 'Although homologous recombination (HR) is indicated as a high-fidelity repair mechanism, break-induced replication (BIR), a subtype of HR, is a mutagenic mechanism that leads to chromosome rearrangements. It remains poorly understood how cells suppress mutagenic BIR. Trapping of Topoisomerase 1 by camptothecin (CPT) in a cleavage complex on the DNA can be transformed into single-ended double-strand breaks (seDSBs) upon DNA replication or colliding with transcriptional machinery. Here, we demonstrate a role of Abraxas in limiting seDSBs undergoing BIR-dependent mitotic DNA synthesis. Through counteracting K63-linked ubiquitin modification, Abraxas restricts SLX4/Mus81 recruitment to CPT damage sites for cleavage and subsequent resection processed by MRE11 endonuclease, CtIP, and DNA2/BLM. Uncontrolled SLX4/MUS81 loading and excessive end resection due to Abraxas-deficiency leads to increased mitotic DNA synthesis via RAD52- and POLD3- dependent, RAD51-independent BIR and extensive chromosome aberrations. Our work implicates Abraxas/BRCA1-A complex as a critical regulator that restrains BIR for protection of genome stability.',\n",

A TCIA curation team tested the utility of the evaluation dataset. With this publication, the evaluation dataset (containing synthetic PHI) and de-identified evaluation dataset (the result of TCIA curation) are released on TCIA in advance of a competition, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), for algorithmic de-identification of medical image datasets. The competition will use a much larger evaluation dataset constructed in the same manner. This paper describes the creation of the evaluation datasets and guidelines for their use.',\n",
              " 'Poised enhancers (PEs) represent a genetically distinct set of distal regulatory elements that control the expression of major developmental genes. Before becoming activated in differentiating cells, PEs are already bookmarked in pluripotent cells with unique chromatin and topological features that could contribute to their privileged regulatory properties. However, since PEs were originally characterized in embryonic stem cells (ESC), it is currently unknown whether PEs are functionally conserved in vivo. Here, we show that the chromatin and 3D structural features of PEs are conserved among mouse pluripotent cells both in vitro and in vivo. We also uncovered that the interactions between PEs and their target genes are globally controlled by the combined action of Polycomb, Trithorax and architectural proteins. Moreover, distal regulatory sequences located close to developmental genes and displaying the typical genetic (i.e. CpG islands) and chromatin (i.e. high accessibility and H3K27me3 levels) features of PEs are commonly found across vertebrates. These putative PEs show high sequence conservation within specific vertebrate clades, with only a few being evolutionary conserved across all vertebrates. Lastly, by genetically disrupting PEs in mouse and chicken embryos, we demonstrate that these regulatory elements play essential roles during the induction of major developmental genes in vivo.',\n",
              " 'Bacterial extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs) play critical roles in virulence. Many bacteria assemble EPSs via a multi-protein Wzx-Wzy system, involving glycan polymerization at the outer face of the cytoplasmic/inner membrane. Gram-negative species couple polymerization with translocation across the periplasm and outer membrane and the master regulator of the system is the tyrosine autokinase, Wzc. This near atomic cryo-EM structure of dephosphorylated Wzc from E. coli shows an octameric assembly with a large central cavity formed by transmembrane helices. The tyrosine autokinase domain forms the cytoplasm region, while the periplasmic region contains small folded motifs and helical bundles. The helical bundles are essential for function, most likely through interaction with the outer membrane translocon, Wza. Autophosphorylation of the tyrosine-rich C-terminus of Wzc results in disassembly of the octamer into multiply phosphorylated monomers. We propose that the cycling between phosphorylated monomer and dephosphorylated octamer regulates glycan polymerization and translocation.',\n",
              " 'Conformational changes in ion channels lead to gating of an ion-conductive pore. Ion flux has been measured with high temporal resolution by single-channel electrophysiology for decades. However, correlation between functional and conformational dynamics remained difficult, lacking experimental techniques to monitor sub-millisecond conformational changes. Here, we use the outer membrane protein G (OmpG) as a model system where loop-6 opens and closes the ß-barrel pore like a lid in a pH-dependent manner. Functionally, single-channel electrophysiology shows that while closed states are favored at acidic pH and open states are favored at physiological pH, both states coexist and rapidly interchange in all conditions. Using HS-AFM height spectroscopy (HS-AFM-HS), we monitor sub-millisecond loop-6 conformational dynamics, and compare them to the functional dynamics from single-channel recordings, while MD simulations provide atomistic details and energy landscapes of the pH-dependent loop-6 fluctuations. HS-AFM-HS offers new opportunities to analyze conformational dynamics at timescales of domain and loop fluctuations.',\n",
              " 'Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) comprise one of the most common histologic types of human cancer. Transcriptional dysregulation of SCC cells is orchestrated by tumor protein p63 (TP63), a master transcription factor (TF) and a well-researched SCC-specific oncogene. In the present study, both Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of SCC patient samples and in vitro loss-of-function assays establish fatty-acid metabolism as a key pathway downstream of TP63. Further studies identify sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) as a central mediator linking TP63 with fatty-acid metabolism, which regulates the biosynthesis of fatty-acids, sphingolipids (SL), and glycerophospholipids (GPL), as revealed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based lipidomics. Moreover, a feedback co-regulatory loop consisting of SREBF1/TP63/Kruppel like factor 5 (KLF5) is identified, which promotes overexpression of all three TFs in SCCs. Downstream of SREBF1, a non-canonical, SCC-specific function is elucidated: SREBF1 cooperates with TP63/KLF5 to regulate hundreds of cis-regulatory elements across the SCC epigenome, which converge on activating cancer-promoting pathways. Indeed, SREBF1 is essential for SCC viability and migration, and its overexpression is associated with poor survival in SCC patients. Taken together, these data shed light on mechanisms of transcriptional dysregulation in cancer, identify specific epigenetic regulators of lipid metabolism, and uncover SREBF1 as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker in SCC.',\n",

              " 'There is a strong demand for methods that can efficiently reconstruct valid super-resolution intact genome 3D structures from sparse and noise single-cell Hi-C data. Here, we develop Single-Cell Chromosome Conformation Calculator (Si-C) within the Bayesian theory framework and apply this approach to reconstruct intact genome 3D structures from single-cell Hi-C data of eight G1-phase haploid mouse ES cells. The inferred 100-kb and 10-kb structures consistently reproduce the known conserved features of chromatin organization revealed by independent imaging experiments. The analysis of the 10-kb resolution 3D structures reveals cell-to-cell varying domain structures in individual cells and hyperfine structures in domains, such as loops. An average of 0.2 contact reads per divided bin is sufficient for Si-C to obtain reliable structures. The valid super-resolution structures constructed by Si-C demonstrate the potential for visualizing and investigating interactions between all chromatin loci at the genome scale in individual cells.',\n",

              " \"Episodic memory entails the storage of events together with their spatio-temporal context and retrieval comprises the subjective experience of a link between the person who remembers and the episode itself. We used an encoding procedure with mobile-phones to generate experimentally-controlled episodes in the real world: object-images were sent to the participants' phone, with encoding durations up to 3\\xa0weeks. In other groups of participants, the same objects were encoded during the exploration of a virtual town (45\\xa0min) or using a standard laboratory paradigm, with pairs of object/place-images presented in a sequence of unrelated trials (15\\xa0min). At retrieval, we tested subjective memory for the objects (remember/familiar) and memory for the context (place and time). We found that accurate and confident context-memory increased the likelihood of remember responses, in all encoding contexts. We also tested the participants' ability to judge the temporal-order of the encoded episodes. Using a model of temporal similarity, we demonstrate scale-invariant properties of order-retrieval, but also highlight the contribution of non-chronological factors. We conclude that the mechanisms governing episodic memory retrieval can operate across a wide range of spatio-temporal contexts and that the multi-dimensional nature of the episodic traces contributes to the subjective experience of retrieval.\",\n",
              " 'Many organisms live in the soil but only a little is known about their ecology especially movement style. Scarab beetle larvae do not have appendages to shovel soil and their trunk is thick compared to their body length. Hence, their movement through the soil is perplexing. Here, we established the observation and analysis system of larval movement and found that the last larval instars of Trypoxylus dichotomus burrow in two different ways, depending on the hardness of the soil. If the soil is soft, the larvae keep their body in a straight line and use longitudinal expansion and contraction; if the soil is hard, they flex and rotate their body. It is thought that the larvae adapt to diverse soil conditions using two different excavation methods. These results are important for understanding the soil ecology and pose a challenge to engineer of newer excavation technology.',\n",

              " 'Species from the Culex coronator complex are Neotropical species and potential vectors of Saint Louis and West Nile viruses. Culex coronator was first described in Trinidad and Tobago in the early twentieth century and since then it has invaded and has been reported established in most countries of the Americas. Species from the Culex coronator complex were first detected in the United States in the state of Louisiana in 2004 and were subsequently detected in Florida in 2005, reaching Miami-Dade County in 2008. We hypothesize that species from the Cx. coronator complex are adapting to urban environments in Miami-Dade County, Florida, and are becoming more present and abundant in these areas. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the patterns of the presence and abundance of species from the Cx. coronator complex in the urban areas of Miami-Dade County. Here we used weekly data comprised of 32 CDC traps from 2012 to 2020 and 150 BG-Sentinel traps from 2016 to 2020. A total of 34,146 female mosquitoes from the Cx. coronator complex were collected, 26,138 by CDC traps and 8008 by BG-Sentinel traps. While the number of CDC traps that were positive was relatively constant at 26-30 positive traps per year, the number of positive BG-Sentinel traps varied substantially from 50 to 87 positive traps per year. Furthermore, the heat map and logistic general linear model for repeated measures analyses showed a significant increase in both the distribution and abundance of mosquitoes from the Cx. coronator complex, indicating that these species are becoming more common in anthropized habitats being able to thrive in highly urbanized areas. The increase in the distribution and abundance of species from the Cx. coronator complex is a major public health concern. The ability of species from the Cx. coronator complex to benefit from urbanization highlights the need to better understand the mechanisms of how invasive vector mosquito species are adapting and exploiting urban habitats.',\n",

This retrospective study serves to evaluate the performance of multi-view convolutional neural networks (MV-CNNs) for automated eye and tumor segmentation on MRI in retinoblastoma patients. Forty retinoblastoma and 20 healthy-eyes from 30 patients were included in a train/test (N = 29 retinoblastoma-, 17 healthy-eyes) and independent validation (N = 11 retinoblastoma-, 3 healthy-eyes) set. Imaging was done using 3.0\\xa0T Fast Imaging Employing Steady-state Acquisition (FIESTA), T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences. Sclera, vitreous humour, lens, retinal detachment and tumor were manually delineated on FIESTA images to serve as a reference standard.

Additionally, the effects of multi-scale, sequences and data augmentation were explored. Optimal performance was obtained by using a three-level pyramid MV-CNN with FIESTA, T2 and T1c sequences and data augmentation. Eye and tumor volumetric ICC were 0.997 and 0.996, respectively. Median [Interquartile range] DSC for eye, sclera, vitreous, lens, retinal detachment and tumor were 0.965 [0.950-0.975], 0.847 [0.782-0.893], 0.975 [0.930-0.986], 0.909 [0.847-0.951], 0.828 [0.458-0.962] and 0.914 [0.852-0.958], respectively.

              " 'Mechanoreceptors on the skin are heterogeneously distributed, and the sampling of neural signals in the brain can vary depending on the part of the body. Therefore, it can be challenging for the brain to consistently represent stimuli applied to different body sites. Here, we report an example of a regional perceptual distortion of the tactile space. We used a piezoelectric braille display to examine shape perception on the volar surface of the arm and to compare it to that on the palm. We found that the orientation of perceived stimuli on the arm was distorted in certain areas. In particular, an inwardly-inclined line shape was perceived as being more inwardly-inclined than it actually was. On the other hand, an outwardly-inclined line was perceived accurately. When the same stimuli were applied to the palm, this anisotropic bias was not observed. We also found that changing the posture of the arm changed the angle at which this anisotropic distortion occurred, suggesting the influence of the skin frame of reference on this illusion. This study showed a clear example of how the representation of even simple stimuli is complexly distinct when the stimuli are applied to different body sites.',\n",

There is still a lack of a comprehensive model describing these complex associations. We present a Bayesian disease model that provides insight in the spatiotemporal distribution of KD in Canada from 2004 to 2017. The disease model including environmental factors had improved Watanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC) compared to the base model which included only spatiotemporal and demographic effects and had excellent performance in recapitulating the spatiotemporal distribution of KD in Canada (98% and 86% spatial and temporal correlations, respectively). The model suggests an association between\\xa0the distribution of KD and population composition, weather-related factors, aeroallergen exposure, pollution, atmospheric concentration of spores and algae, and the incidence of healthcare encounters for bacterial pneumonia or viral intestinal infections. This model could be the basis of a hypothetical data-driven framework for the spatiotemporal distribution of KD. It also generates novel hypotheses about the etiology of KD, and provides a basis for the future development of a predictive and surveillance model.',\n",

Based on the topological and pathway enrichment analysis of proteins in PPI network, 12 candidate genes were shortlisted. By further validating these candidate genes in seeded and seedless accession of Musa spp. we put forward MaAGL8, MaMADS16, MaGH3.8, MaMADS29, MaRGA1, MaEXPA1, MaGID1C, MaHK2 and MaBAM1 as possible target genes in the study of natural parthenocarpy.

              " 'Several studies have reported that the prognostic effect of KRAS mutations on colorectal cancers (CRCs) varies depending on the type of mutation. Considering the effect of KRAS mutations on tumor microenvironment, we analyzed the prognostic significance of KRAS mutation types after adjusting for the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and tumor-stromal percentage (TSP) statuses. In two independent cohorts, KRAS mutations were analyzed by Sanger sequencing and/or next-generation sequencing. TIL density and the TSP were quantified from whole-slide immunohistochemical images. KRAS-mutant CRCs were divided into three subgroups (G12D/V, other codon 12 mutations and codon 13 mutations) to examine their differential effect on TIL density, the TSP and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Among the KRAS mutations, only the G12D/V subgroups showed significantly less TIL infiltration than the wild-type CRCs. According to survival analysis, G12D/V mutations were associated with short RFS; codon 13 mutations showed discordant trends in the two cohorts, and other codon 12 mutations showed no significant association. Multivariate analysis further supported the prognostic value of G12D/V mutations. This result is not only consistent with a recent study suggesting the immunosuppressive effect of mutant KRAS but also provides insight into the type-specific prognostic effect of KRAS mutations.',\n",

GADD45 proteins mediate DNA repair in different cells including keratinocytes. In the immune system, GADD45a and GADD45b regulate the function and activation of both T lymphocytes and dendritic cells and GADD45a links DNA repair and epigenetic regulation through its demethylase activity. Here, we analyzed the expression of GADD45a and GADD45b in the skin, dendritic cells and circulating T cells in a cohort of psoriasis patients and their regulation by inflammatory signals. Thirty patients (17 male/13 female) with plaque psoriasis and 15 controls subjects (7 male/8 female), were enrolled. Psoriasis patients exhibited a lower expression of GADD45a at the epidermis but a higher expression in dermal infiltrating T cells in lesional skin. The expression of GADD45a and GADD45b was also higher in peripheral T cells from psoriasis patients, although no differences were observed in p38 activation. The expression and methylation state of the GADD45a target UCHL1 were evaluated, revealing a hypermethylation of its promoter in lesional skin compared to controls. Furthermore, reduced levels of GADD45a correlated with a lower expression UCHL1 in lesional skin. We propose that the demethylase function of GADD45a may account for its pleiotropic effects, and the complex and heterogeneous pattern of expression observed in psoriatic disease.',\n",

Multiple testing corrections were done by the Benjamini-Hochberg method through assessment of significance at a false discovery rate of 10%. We genotyped and investigated rs1048943/CYP1A1 in a case-control sample from eastern India, followed by its global meta-analysis using a similar protocol. Meta-analysis of 18 variants of 11 genes reported in 39 studies (7630 cases and 8169 controls) showed significant association of rs1048943/CYP1A1 [2.07(1.49-2.87)] and rs4646903/CYP1A1 [1.48(1.93-1.95)] with overall lung cancer risk at 10% FDR, while nominal association (p < 0.05) was observed for del1/GSTT1, del2/GSTM1, rs1695/GSTP1 and rs17037102/ DKK2. Subtype analysis showed a significant association of del1/GSTT1 with adenocarcinoma, rs4646903/CYP1A1 with squamous carcinoma, and rs1048943/CYP1A1 with both. Association of rs4646903/CYP1A1 in smokers and effect modification by meta-regression analysis was observed.

              " 'Social hierarchy is a potent modulator of behavior, that is typically established through overt agonistic interactions between individuals in the group. Once established, social ranks are maintained through subtler interactions allowing the redirection of energy away from agonistic interactions towards other needs. The available tasks for assessing social rank in rats allow the study of the mechanisms by which social hierarches are formed in early phases but fail to assess the maintenance of established hierarchies between stable pairs of animals, which might rely on distinct neurobiological mechanisms. Here we present and validate a novel trial-based dominancy assay, the modified Food Competition test, where established social hierarchies can be identified in the home cage of non-food deprived pairs of male rats. In this task, we introduce a small conflict in the home cage, where access to a new feeder containing palatable pellets can only be gained by one animal at a time. We found that this subtle conflict triggered asymmetric social interactions and resulted in higher consumption of food by one of the animals in the pair, which reliably predicted hierarchy in other tests. Our findings reveal stable dominance status in pair-housed rats and provide a novel tool for the evaluation of established social hierarchies, the modified Food Competition test, that is robust and easy to implement.',\n",

In conclusion, a high leptospiremia, pNGAL, and IL-6 level at baseline were associated with severe leptospirosis.',\n",
              " 'Cleft lip and palate (CL/P) is the most prevalent craniofacial birth defect in humans. None of the surgical procedures currently used for CL/P repair lead to definitive correction of hard palate bone interruption. Advances in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine aim to develop new strategies to restore palatal bone interruption by using tissue or organ-decellularized bioscaffolds seeded with host cells. Aim of this study was to set up a new natural scaffold deriving from a decellularized porcine mucoperiosteum, engineered by an innovative micro-perforation procedure based on Quantum Molecular Resonance (QMR) and then subjected to in vitro recellularization with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs). Our results demonstrated the efficiency of decellularization treatment gaining a natural, non-immunogenic scaffold with preserved collagen microenvironment that displays a favorable support to hMSC engraftment, spreading and differentiation. Ultrastructural analysis showed that the micro-perforation procedure preserved the collagen mesh, increasing the osteoinductive potential for mesenchymal precursor cells. In conclusion, we developed a novel tissue engineering protocol to obtain a non-immunogenic mucoperiosteal scaffold suitable for allogenic transplantation and CL/P repair. The innovative micro-perforation procedure improving hMSC osteogenic differentiation potentially impacts for enhanced palatal bone regeneration leading to future clinical applications in humans.',\n",

From the de-identified database of three hospitals, 889 patients < 15\\xa0years of age diagnosed with T1D or T2D (393 boys, 664 T1D patients) were enrolled. Diagnosis was defined as first exposure to antidiabetic drug at each center. Compared with T2D patients, T1D patients had lower BMIz at diagnosis (- 0.4 ± 1.2 vs. 1.5 ± 1.4, p < 0.001) and 3\\xa0months (- 0.1 ± 1.0 vs. 1.5 ± 1.5, p < 0.001), and higher HbA1c levels at diagnosis (10.0 ± 2.6% vs. 9.5 ± 2.7%, p < 0.01). After 3\\xa0months, HbA1c levels reached a nadir of 7.6% and 6.5% in T1D and T2D patients, respectively, followed by progressive increases; only 10.4% of T1D and 29.7% of T2D patients achieved the recommended HbA1c target (< 7.0%) at 60\\xa0months. T1D patients showed consistent increases in BMIz; T2D patients showed no significant change in BMIz during follow-up. Peri-pubertal girls with T1D had higher HbA1c and BMIz values. Achieving optimal glycemic control and preventing obesity should be emphasized in pediatric diabetes care.',\n",

This prospective study recruited patients with new-onset ON between January 2015 and March 2017 who were followed-up for 3\\xa0years. They were divided into the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-seropositive (MOG-ON), aquaporin-4-seropositive (AQP4-ON), and double-seronegative (seronegative-ON) groups, and their clinical characteristics and imaging findings were evaluated and compared. Two-hundred-eighty patients (405 eyes) were included (MOG-ON: n = 57, 20.4%; AQP4-ON: n = 98, 35.0%; seronegative-ON: n = 125, 44.6%). The proportion of eyes with best-corrected visual acuity > 20/25 at the 3-year follow-up was similar between the MOG-ON and seronegative-ON groups; the proportion in both groups was higher than that in the AQP4-ON group (p < 0.001). Relapse rates were higher in the MOG-ON and AQP4-ON groups than in the seronegative-ON group (p < 0.001). Average retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness at 3\\xa0years was similar between the MOG-ON and AQP4-ON groups (63.41 ± 13.39 and 59.40 ± 11.46\\xa0µm, p = 0.476) but both were thinner than the seronegative-ON group (74.06 ± 11.14\\xa0µm, p < 0.001). Macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) revealed the same pattern. Despite RNFL and GCIPL thinning, the MOG-ON group's outcome was as favorable as that of the seronegative-ON group, whereas the AQP4-ON group showed unsatisfactory results.\",\n",
              " 'Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause for cancer-related deaths in men and women worldwide. Sufficient screening tools enabling early diagnosis are essential to improve patient outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum midkine (S-MK) both as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This single-center analysis included 59 NSCLC patients counting 30 squamous cell cancers and 29 adenocarcinomas. Preoperative S-MK concentration was determined using ELISA. Patients were followed up to five years. S-MK was found to be significantly overexpressed in patients with NSCLC compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001). The discriminative power of S-MK to differentiate NSCLC subjects from controls was fairly high with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 (p < 0.001). Optimal sensitivity of 92% and reasonable specificity of 68% was reached at a threshold of 416\\xa0pg/ml S-MK. Patients with high S-MK concentration showed a significantly shorter overall survival compared to patients with low S-MK expression (p < 0.05). In conclusion, S-MK is overexpressed in patients with NSCLC and serves as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. S-MK may thus be considered as an additional non-invasive biomarker not only for NSCLC screening but also for outcome prediction.',\n",
              " 'Two common strategies organisms use to finance reproduction are capital breeding (using energy stored prior to reproduction) and income breeding (using energy gathered during the reproductive period). Understanding which of these two strategies a species uses can help in predicting its population dynamics and how it will respond to environmental change. Brachyuran crabs have historically been considered capital breeders as a group, but recent evidence has challenged this assumption. Here, we focus on the mangrove tree crab, Aratus pisonii, and examine its breeding strategy on the Atlantic Florida coast. We collected crabs during and after their breeding season (March-October) and dissected them to discern how energy was stored and utilized for reproduction. We found patterns of reproduction and energy storage that are consistent with both the use of stored energy (capital) and energy acquired (income) during the breeding season. We also found that energy acquisition and storage patterns that supported reproduction were influenced by unequal tidal patterns associated with the syzygy tide inequality cycle. Contrary to previous assumptions for crabs, we suggest that species of crab that produce multiple clutches of eggs during long breeding seasons (many tropical and subtropical species) may commonly use income breeding strategies.',\n",

A total of 30 patients with LSCC with immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for MCM-2, Ki-67 and EGFR were examined. Mean expression levels of the three markers were evaluated for comparing between early and advanced stages of LSCC. The mean MCM-2, Ki-67, and EGFR expression levels were significantly decreased in advanced-stage compared with early-stage LSCC. Pearson correlation analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between the MCM-2 and Ki-67. Regarding subgroup analyses, MCM-2, Ki-67, and EGFR showed significant differences between early- and advanced-stage LSCC with non-recurrence, while for the recurrent subgroup LSCC, only MCM-2 revealed a significant difference between early- and advanced-stage LSCC. Altogether, these results support the role for downregulation of MCM-2, Ki-67 and EGFR in advanced-stage LSCC and correlation of MCM-2 and Ki-67 expressions that would be a promising strategy to predict prognosis of LSCC including severity and progression. We contextualize our findings and advocate the position of the biological markers, especially MCM-2, as an emerging evaluation tool for LSCC disease.',\n",

Besides, we seek to identify novel prognosis indicators for HBV-HCC patients. Between April 2009 and March 2015, this work enrolled 868 patients diagnosed with HBV-HCC and undergoing RH in the Liver Surgery Department, West China Hospital, Sichuan University (WCHSU). The basic information, laboratory examination indicators, pathological reports, and follow-up data of patients were included. SPSS 22.0 statistical software was used for statistical data analyses. Platelet (PLT), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), maximum diameter (max-D), number of tumors (Number), degree of differentiation (DD), Microvascular invasion situation (MVI), satellite focus situation (SF), PNI, and ALBI were the independent risk factors for both overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of HBV-HCC patients undergoing RH. Taking PNI = 46 and ALBI = -\\xa02.80 as cut-off values, the OS and DFS of the PNI-high group were significantly higher than those of the PNI-low group. Meanwhile, the OS and DFS of the ALBI-low group were significantly higher than those of the ALBI-high group; the OS and DFS of the PNI-high + ALBI-low group were significantly higher than those of the PNI-low + ALBI-high group. Xie prognostic index (XPI) was the independent risk factor for both OS and DFS of HBV-HCC patients undergoing RH. The OS and DFS of the XPI-high group were significantly higher than those of the XPI-low group. This paper reveals that preoperative PNI and ALBI can predict the OS and DFS of HBV-HCC patients undergoing RH. Their impact on the prognosis of HBV-HCC patients is insignificant, however, it cannot be ignored. XPI can precisely predict the prognosis of HBV-HCC patients undergoing RH, nonetheless, its effect requires additional research for validation.',\n",

Multidisciplinary evaluation of the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card (BinaxNOW, a widely used rapid antigen test, included limit of detection, variant detection, test performance across different age-groups, and usability with self/caregiver-administration. While BinaxNOW detected the highly infectious variants, B.1.1.7 (Alpha) first identified in the UK, B.1.351 (Beta) first identified in South Africa, P.1 (Gamma) first identified in Brazil, B.1.617.2 (Delta) first identified in India and B.1.2, a non-VOC, test sensitivity decreased with decreasing viral loads. Moreover, BinaxNOW sensitivity trended lower when devices were performed by patients/caregivers themselves compared to trained clinical staff, despite universally high usability assessments following self/caregiver-administration among different age groups. Overall, these data indicate that while BinaxNOW accurately detects the new viral variants, as rapid COVID-19 tests enter the home, their already lower sensitivities compared to RT-PCR may decrease even more due to user error.',\n",
              " 'Previous studies regarding the zinc status in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) yielded inconsistent results. Thus, the present meta-analysis was aimed to estimate the association between hair and serum/plasma zinc levels and ADHD. Online databases of Medline, EMBASE, and Scopus were searched up to October 2020 with no limitation in time and language. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) of hair and serum/plasma zinc levels were calculated using a random-effects model. Overall, 22 articles with 1280 subjects with ADHD and 1200 controls were included. The pooled effect size indicated that serum/plasma zinc levels in subjects with ADHD were not statistically different than their controls (WMD = - 1.26\\xa0µmol/L; 95% CI - 3.72, 1.20). Interestingly, the exclusion of one study from the analysis showed that people with ADHD significantly have lower circulating levels of zinc compared to their controls (WMD: - 2.49\\xa0µmol/L; 95% CI - 4.29, - 0.69). Also, the pooled effect size indicated that hair zinc levels in cases with ADHD were not statistically different than their controls (WMD = - 24.19\\xa0µg/g; 95% CI - 61.80, 13.42). Present meta-analysis raises the possibility that subjects with ADHD are prone to have declined levels of zinc levels. Based on current findings, screening the zinc levels in subjects with ADHD could be reasonable. Further well-designed studies are needed to clarify the role of zinc in the etiology of ADHD.',\n",

However, rarely the previous study has addressed the role of CTSA in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its prognostic value. To study the clinical value and potential function of CTSA in HCC, datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and a 136 HCC patient cohort were analyzed. CTSA expression was found to be significantly higher in HCC patients compared with normal liver tissues, which was supported by immunohistochemistry (IHC) validation. Both gene ontology (GO) and The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses demonstrated that CTSA co-expressed genes were involved in ATP hydrolysis coupled proton transport, carbohydrate metabolic process, lysosome organization, oxidative phosphorylation, other glycan degradation, etc. Survival analysis showed a significant reduction both in overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) of patients with high CTSA expression from both the TCGA HCC cohort and 136 patients with the HCC cohort. Furthermore, CTSA overexpression has diagnostic value in distinguishing between HCC and normal liver tissue [Area under curve (AUC) = 0.864]. Moreover, Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that CTSA expression correlated with the oxidative phosphorylation, proteasome, and lysosome, etc. in HCC tissues. These findings demonstrate that CTSA may as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in HCC.',\n",

Among patients on low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV), we investigated if further adherence to the low PEEP/FIO2 (inspired oxygen fraction) table would be associated with better survival compared to nonadherence. Patients with ARDS, admitted directly from the Emergency Department to our 20-bed Medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from August 2016 to July 2017, were retrospectively studied. To determine adherence to the low PEEP/FIO2 table, PEEP and FIO2 12\\xa0h after ICU admission were used, to reflect ventilator adjustments by ICU clinicians after initial stabilization. Logistic regression was used to analyze hospital mortality as an outcome with adherence to the low PEEP/FIO2 as the key independent variable, adjusted for age, APACHE II score, initial P/F ratio and initial systolic blood pressure. 138 patients with ARDS were analysed. Overall adherence to the low PEEP/FIO2 table was 75.4%. Among patients on LTVV, nonadherence to the low PEEP/FIO2 table was associated with increased mortality compared to adherence (adjusted odds ratio 4.10, 95% confidence interval 1.68-9.99, P = 0.002). Patient characteristics at baseline were not associated with adherence to the low PEEP/FIO2 table.',\n",

Substantial work has focused on characterizing the molecular substrates\\xa0that underlie these persistent changes in neural function and behavior. However, this work has overwhelmingly focused on male subjects, despite mounting clinical and preclinical evidence that females demonstrate dissimilar progression to SUD and responsivity to stimulant drugs of abuse, such as cocaine. Here, we show that sex is a critical biological variable that defines drug-induced plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we assessed the protein expression patterns induced by cocaine self-administration and demonstrated unique molecular profiles between males and females. We show that 1. Cocaine self-administration induces non-overlapping protein expression patterns in significantly regulated proteins in males and females and 2. Critically, cocaine-induced protein regulation differentially interacts with sex to eliminate basal sexual dimorphisms in the proteome. Finally, eliminating these baseline differences in the proteome is concomitant with the elimination of sex differences in behavior for non-drug rewards. Together, these data suggest that cocaine administration is capable of rewriting basal proteomic function and reward-associated behaviors.',\n",
              " 'Senescent vascular cells are detected in atherosclerotic lesion, and its involvement in the development of atherosclerosis has been revealed; however, whether and the mechanism by which endothelial cell (EC) senescence is causally implicated in atherosclerosis remains unclear. We here investigate a role of EC senescence in atherosclerosis by utilizing EC-specific progeroid mice that overexpress the dominant negative form of telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 under the control of the Tie2 or vascular endothelial cadherin promoter. EC-specific progeria accelerated atherosclerosis in mice with target deletion of ApoE. Mechanistically, senescent ECs were markedly sensitive for inflammation-mediated VCAM-1 induction, leading to enhanced monocyte adhesion. Inhibition of NF-?B signaling abolished the enhanced inflammatory responses in senescent ECs, while NF-?B nuclear translocation in response to TNF-a were similar between young and senescent ECs. We found a higher association of VCAM-1 gene with active histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 4, leading to increased NF-?B accessibility in senescent ECs. Our data revealed that EC cellular senescence causes endothelial hyper-inflammability through epigenetic alteration, which consequently accelerates atherosclerosis. Therefore, EC senescence is a promising therapeutic target for the prevention and/or treatment of atherosclerotic disease in elderly population.',\n",
              " 'The resilience of coral reefs is dependent on the ability of corals to settle after disturbances. While crustose coralline algae (CCA) are considered important substrates for coral settlement, it remains unclear whether coral larvae respond to CCA metabolites and microbial cues when selecting sites for attachment and metamorphosis. This study tested the settlement preferences of an abundant coral species (Acropora cytherea) against six different CCA species from three habitats (exposed, subcryptic and cryptic), and compared these preferences with the metabolome and microbiome characterizing the CCA. While all CCA species induced settlement, only one species (Titanoderma prototypum) significantly promoted settlement on the CCA surface, rather than on nearby dead coral or plastic surfaces. This species had a very distinct bacterial community and metabolomic fingerprint. Furthermore, coral settlement rates and the CCA microbiome and metabolome were specific to the CCA preferred habitat, suggesting that microbes and/or chemicals serve as environmental indicators for coral larvae. Several amplicon sequence variants and two lipid classes-glycoglycerolipids and betaine lipids-present in T. prototypum were identified as potential omic cues influencing coral settlement. These results support that the distinct microbiome and metabolome of T. prototypum may promote the settlement and attachment of coral larvae.',\n",

Although the influence of different range of motions and muscle-tendon unit lengths has been investigated in pure stretch-hold experiments in vivo, the contribution to a SSC movement in human muscles remains unclear. In two sessions, 25 healthy participants performed isometric reference (ISO), shortening hold (SHO) and SSC contractions on an isokinetic dynamometer. We measured the net knee-joint torque, rotational mechanical work, knee kinematics and fascicle behavior (m. vastus lateralis) of the upper right leg. In session 1 the SHO- and SSC-magnitude was changed respectively (SHO: 50°-20°, 80°-20° and 110°-20°; SSC: 20°-50°-20°, 20°-80°-20° and 20°-110°-20°) and in session 2 the muscle-tendon unit length (SHO: 50°-20°, 80°-50° and 110°-80°; SSC: 20°-50°-20°, 50°-80°-50° and 80°-110°-80°; straight leg = 0°). In both sessions, rotational work was significantly (p < 0.05) increased in the SSC compared to the SHO contractions (in the range of 8.1-17.9%). No significant difference of joint torque was found in the steady-state for all SSC-magnitudes compared to the corresponding SHO contractions in session 1. In session 2, we found only significantly (p < 0.05) less depressed joint torque in the SSC at the longest muscle-tendon unit length compared to the corresponding SHO condition, without any differences in knee kinematics and fascicle behavior. Therefore, the physiological relevance of rFE might be particularly important for movements at greater muscle-tendon unit lengths.',\n",

After pre-incubating W27 IgA with the respective fecal sample under aerobic conditions, the mixture of W27 IgA (final concentration, 0.5\\xa0µg/mL) and each fecal sample was added to the in vitro microbiota model and cultured under anaerobic conditions. Next-generation sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that W27 IgA significantly decreased the relative abundance of bacteria related to the genus Escherichia in the model. Additionally, at a final concentration of 5\\xa0µg/mL, W27 IgA delayed growth in the pure culture of Escherichia coli isolated from human fecal samples. Our study thus revealed the suppressive effect of W27 IgA on the genus Escherichia at relatively low-concentrations and the usefulness of an in vitro microbiota model to evaluate the effect of IgA as a gut microbiota regulator.',\n",

Based on these analyses and measurements of patch reflectance spectra, we infer that white patches are due to modified air sacs under transparent cuticle. These air sacs show internal arborisations with beads in an empty space, constituting a three-dimensional photonic solid responsible for light scattering. The white patches also show UV-induced blue autofluorescence due to the air sac resilin content. To the best of our knowledge, this research describes a specialized function for air sacs and the first observation of structural color produced by tracheal structures located under transparent cuticles in insects. Sexual dimorphism in the spectral emission also lays a structural basis for further investigations on the biological role of white patches in B. oleae.',\n",
              " 'Cytosine or adenine base editors (CBEs or ABEs) hold great promise in therapeutic applications because they enable the precise conversion of targeted base changes without generating of double-strand breaks. However, both CBEs and ABEs induce substantial off-target DNA editing, and extensive off-target RNA single nucleotide variations in transfected cells. Therefore, the potential effects of deaminases induced by DNA base editors are of great importance for their clinical applicability. Here, the transcriptome-wide deaminase effects on gene expression and splicing is examined. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differential alternative splicing (DAS) events, induced by base editors, are identified. Both CBEs and ABEs generated thousands of DEGs and hundreds of DAS events. For engineered CBEs or ABEs, base editor-induced variants had little effect on the elimination of DEGs and DAS events. Interestingly, more DEGs and DAS events are observed as a result of over expressions of cytosine and adenine deaminases. This study reveals a previously overlooked aspect of deaminase effects in transcriptome-wide gene expression and splicing, and underscores the need to fully characterize such effects of deaminase enzymes in base editor platforms.',\n",
              " 'Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induction of cell death is implicated in cardiovascular diseases. Sustained activation of ER-stress induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways, which in turn activate three major effector proteins. We previously reported a missense homozygous mutation in FBXO32 (MAFbx, Atrogin-1) causing advanced heart failure by impairing autophagy. In the present study, we performed transcriptional profiling and biochemical assays, which unexpectedly revealed a reduced activation of UPR effectors in patient mutant hearts, while a strong up-regulation of the CHOP transcription factor and of its target genes are observed. Expression of mutant FBXO32 in cells is sufficient to induce CHOP-associated apoptosis, to increase the ATF2 transcription factor and to impair ATF2 ubiquitination. ATF2 protein interacts with FBXO32 in the human heart and its expression is especially high in FBXO32 mutant hearts. These findings provide a new underlying mechanism for FBXO32-mediated cardiomyopathy, implicating abnormal activation of CHOP. These results suggest alternative non-canonical pathways of CHOP activation that could be considered to develop new therapeutic targets for the treatment of FBXO32-associated DCM.',\n",
              " 'The waveguide layer of diffraction-based leaky waveguides (LWs) must be made of materials that have low refractive index, are permeable to analytes, can be deposited by spin coating, and can be functionalised and crosslinked. These requirements are fulfilled by thin films of chitosan hydrogels. In this work, we studied the reproducibility of diffraction-based LWs with chitosan waveguides. The average refractive index sensitivity (RIS) and RI limit of detection (LOD) of the eight devices investigated herein were 125.5 ± 3.8 deg RIU-1 and 1.9 × 10-6 ± 1.3 × 10-6 RIU, respectively. While several challenges associated with the realisation of reproducible chitosan LWs have been addressed, reducing the variations in RI LOD requires improving the adhesion of chitosan films to glass substrates, minimising bubbles trapped in microfluidic channels, and using pumps with minimal pulsations. We showed that the buffer baseline of LWs with unmodified chitosan before and after introducing 750 µM bovine serum albumin (BSA), which is equal to the physiological levels of serum albumin, was different by 3.6%. Nevertheless, using biotin, anti-biotin antibody and BSA as exemplar recognition element, analyte and interferent, respectively, we demonstrated that diffraction-based chitosan LWs were suitable for monitoring analyte-RE binding in the presence of 750 µM BSA.',\n",
              " 'Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is elevated in patients with obesity; however, its contribution to the pathophysiology related to obesity is not fully understood. We hypothesized that high ET-1 levels cause dyslipidemia, inflammation, and insulin resistance within the adipose tissue of obese mice. To test this hypothesis, male C57BL/6J mice were fed either normal diet (NMD) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks followed by 2 weeks of treatment with either vehicle, atrasentan (ETA receptor antagonist, 10 mg/kg/day) or bosentan (ETA/ETB receptor antagonist, 100 mg/kg/day). Atrasentan and bosentan lowered circulating non-esterified free fatty acids and triglycerides seen in HFD mice, while atrasentan-treated mice had significantly lower liver triglycerides compared with non-treated HFD mice. ET-1 receptor blockade significantly improved insulin tolerance compared with insulin-resistant HFD mice and lowered expression of genes in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) associated with insulin resistance and inflammation. Flow cytometric analyses of eWAT indicated that HFD mice had significantly higher percentages of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared with NMD mice, which was attenuated by treatment with atrasentan or bosentan. Atrasentan treatment also abolished the decrease in eosinophils seen in HFD mice. Taken together, these data indicate that ETA and ETA/ETB receptor blockade improves peripheral glucose homeostasis, dyslipidemia and liver triglycerides, and also attenuates the pro-inflammatory immune profile in eWAT of mice fed HFD. These data suggest a potential use for ETA and ETA/ETB receptor blockers in the treatment of obesity-associated dyslipidemia and insulin resistance.',\n",

The goal of the project was to ensure compliance with hazardous drug handling standards and provide adequate employee protection while minimizing the financial burden on the health-system pharmacy.,Investigational drugs that meet any of 4 defined criteria should be subject to hazardous drug handling precautions until adequate safety data are available.',\n",
              " 'A critical shortage of small-volume parenteral solutions in late 2017 led hospitals to develop strategies to ensure availability for critical patients, including administration of antibiotics as intravenous push (IVP). Minimal literature has been published to date that assesses the safety of administration of beta-lactams via this route. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of IVP administration of select beta-lactam antibiotics.,We performed a retrospective review of IVP administrations of aztreonam, ceftriaxone, cefepime, and meropenem at two campuses of the New York University Langone Health system after October 2017. Patients receiving surgical prophylaxis or more than one IVP antibiotic simultaneously were excluded. The primary endpoint was adverse events (ADE) following IVP administration of antibiotics.,We evaluated 1000 patients who received IVP aztreonam (n = 43), ceftriaxone (n = 544), cefepime (n = 368) or meropenem (n = 45). There were 10 (1%) ADE observed, 5 of which were allergic reactions. Four ADE were neurotoxicity related to IVP cefepime. Based on the Naranjo score, 1 adverse event was probably and 3 were possibly related to cefepime IVP administration. Lastly, only 1 report of phlebitis was observed with the use of IVP ceftriaxone.,The use of IVP as an alternative to intravenous piggyback (IVPB) during times of drug shortage for select beta-lactam antibiotics appears to be safe, and ADE are similar to those previously described for IVPB administration. Future studies evaluating clinical outcomes between IVP and IVPB administration may be of benefit.',\n",
              " 'To determine the feasibility of HIV genotyping at low-level viraemia (LLV) using an in-house assay in a South African population and the prevalence, as well as the clinical relevance, of drug resistance (HIVDR) in this population.,We conducted an observational, retrospective, cohort study on patient samples with LLV referred for routine HIVDR testing at a public sector Johannesburg laboratory from August 2017 to October 2018. Genotyping was performed using a nested RT-PCR assay and Sanger sequencing. The genotyping success rate was evaluated for different viraemia categories. Sequences were loaded onto the Stanford HIVdb genotypic resistance tool (version 8.7) for drug resistance interpretation.,Plasma samples from 159 HIV-1-infected, treatment-experienced adults with LLV (5-999 copies/mL) were analysed. The in-house assay performed well with an overall success rate of 78.6% (125/159, 95% CI 71.6-84.3). The prevalence of drug resistance mutations in the LLV cohort was 79.2% (99/125, 95% CI 71.2-85.4) with most patients (n = 109, 68.6%) on a PI-based regimen at the time of genotyping. Of 125 sequences obtained, 73.6% (92/125) had =1 NRTI mutation while 70.4% (88/125) had =1 NNRTI mutation. Major PI mutations, including M46I and V82A, were detected in 7.2% (9/125) of patients.,Current South African virological failure guidelines may keep patients on failing regimens for longer than necessary. Our data suggest that genotyping at LLV is feasible and implementation could result in earlier identification and referral of patients requiring third-line regimens.',\n",

Most guidelines endorse abstaining from immediate antibiotic treatment ('watchful waiting', WW) in mild-moderate episodes. We studied adherence rates to the latest AOM guidelines (2013), in terms of antibiotic type and prescription options.,In this population-based study, AOM episodes were identified in Clalit Health Services-insured children aged 0-10 years between 2011 and 2018, using a data-sharing platform. After identifying the index, prescription and issuing dates for antibiotics for each AOM episode, treatment was categorized as immediate (=2 days after diagnosis) or WW (antibiotic not prescribed/issued; prescribed =2 days after diagnosis but issued on Days 2-7; or prescribed/issued on Days 2-7). Guideline adherence was measured according to age.,Of the 491 106 episodes, 361 518 (73.6%) were treated with antibiotics. Following the 2013 guidelines, the ratio of episodes in children aged =6 months that were adherent (immediate treatment) was higher (OR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.15-1.29; P < 0.001), whereas the adherent episode ratio for children aged 6-24 months and 2-10 years (WW) was lower (OR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.85-0.88 and OR = 0.94; 95% CI 0.92-0.96, respectively; P < 0.001). Antibiotic prescription rates after 2013 for children aged =6 months were not different (OR = 1.03; 95% CI 0.96-1.1; P = 0.4), but were higher in children aged 6-24 months and 2-10 years (OR = 1.07; 95% CI 1.05-1.09; P < 0.001 and OR = 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.04; P = 0.015, respectively).

ICRP Publication 137 recommends a dose coefficient of 3\\xa0mSv per mJ h m-3 (~10\\xa0mSv WLM-1) to be used in most circumstances of radon exposure, for workers in buildings and in underground mines. Recently, United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) reviewed radon epidemiology and dosimetry and concluded that its established dose coefficient of 1.6\\xa0mSv per mJ h m-3 (5.7\\xa0mSv WLM-1) should be retained for use in its comparisons of radiation exposures from different sources in a population. This paper explains and compares the reviews of the scientific evidence from UNSCEAR and ICRP.

The first-line treatment is azithromycin, but macrolide resistance is increasing due to mutations in the 23S rRNA gene.,To determine the rates of M. genitalium infection and macrolide resistance in an area adjacent to Barcelona.,This 1 year prospective study was performed in a heterogenous population that included both low- and high-risk patients. M. genitalium was detected in all specimens sent to our institution for STD detection. Epidemiological and relevant clinical data were collected in the positive cases. Characterization of macrolide-associated resistance was performed by 23S rDNA sequencing.,Of the 3540 patients included, 132 (3.7%) were positive for M. genitalium. Another sexually transmitted bacteria was detected in 20.4% of the M. genitalium cases, and Chlamydia trachomatis (11%) was the most frequently co-detected microorganism. Only 61.4% of patients received an adequate initial treatment against M. genitalium. The test of cure (TOC) was performed in 42% of patients, and therapeutic failure was detected in 10 cases. The rate of macrolide resistance was 12.6% and the most prevalent mutation was A2058G. There was an association between macrolide resistance and a previous history of M. genitalium detection (P < 0.001).,Our results support the contribution of the previous use of macrolides in resistant strains. Given the difficulties in performing TOC in all patients, the inclusion of macrolide resistance in the detection test should be mandatory.',\n",
              " 'Resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pumps are important mediators of antibiotic resistance. RND pumps, including the principal multidrug efflux pump AcrAB-TolC in Salmonella, are tripartite systems with an inner membrane RND transporter, a periplasmic adaptor protein (PAP) and an outer membrane factor (OMF). We previously identified the residues required for binding between the PAP AcrA and the RND transporter AcrB and have demonstrated that PAPs can function with non-cognate transporters. AcrE and AcrD/AcrF are homologues of AcrA and AcrB, respectively. Here, we show that AcrE can interact with AcrD, which does not possess its own PAP, and establish that the residues previously identified in AcrB binding are also involved in AcrD binding.,The acrD and acrE genes were expressed in a strain lacking acrABDEF (?3RND). PAP residues involved in promiscuous interactions were predicted based on previously defined PAP-RND interactions and corresponding mutations generated in acrA and acrE. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the mutant strains was determined.,Co-expression of acrD and acrE significantly decreased susceptibility of the ?3RND strain to AcrD substrates, showing that AcrE can form a functional complex with AcrD. The substrate profile of Salmonella AcrD differed from that of Escherichia coli AcrD. Mutations targeting the previously defined PAP-RND interaction sites in AcrA/AcrE impaired efflux of AcrD-dependent substrates.,These data indicate that AcrE forms an efflux-competent pump with AcrD and thus presents an alternative PAP for this pump. Mutagenesis of the conserved RND binding sites validates the interchangeability of AcrA and AcrE, highlighting them as potential drug targets for efflux inhibition.',\n",

We aimed to use DBSs to estimate pill intake among participants using on-demand pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and to identify predictive factors associated with higher TFV-DP concentrations.,DBSs were collected at the last study visit of the open-label phase of the ANRS IPERGAY study, assessing on-demand oral TDF/emtricitabine for PrEP among MSM and transgender female participants. We quantified TFV-DP in DBSs centrally. We assessed correlation between pill count and TFV-DP concentration by Spearman correlation and explored associations between participant demographics, sexual behaviour and PrEP use during sexual intercourse (SI) with TFV-DP concentrations by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.,The median age of the 245 participants included in this study was 40 years, with a median body weight of 73 kg. Median (IQR) TFV-DP concentration reached 517 (128-868) fmol/punch, corresponding to an estimated intake of 8-12 tablets per month (2-3 doses per week). Only 39% of participants had a TFV-DP concentration above 700 fmol/punch. TFV-DP concentrations were moderately correlated with pill count (r: 0.59; P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, only systematic use of PrEP during SI and more frequent episodes of SI in the past 4 weeks were significantly associated with higher TFV-DP levels [OR (95% CI): 11.30 (3.62-35.33) and 1.46 (1.19-1.79), respectively; P < 0.001].,Among participants using on-demand PrEP, estimated pill intake reached 8-12 tablets per month and was correlated with frequency and systematic use of PrEP for SI.',\n",

In this study, the age-specific functional response, paralysis rate, and parasitism rate of H. hebetor under different host deprivation treatments (PC: without host deprivation, used as the control, P1d: host deprivation, but the host was removed after 1 d contact, and PW: host deprivation from beginning) were evaluated at different larval densities (5, 10, 20, 40, and 80) of the Ephestia elutella (Hübner) at 28 ± 1°C, 75 ± 5% RH and 16:8 h L:D. Ages of parasitoid females used were 2, 5, 10, and 20 d old. The logistic regression results indicated that the functional response of H. hebetor females under different host deprivation treatments was type II. The longest handling time was observed in 20-d old females, while the shortest handling time and highest maximum attack rate (T/Th) were estimated at the age of 2 d in all treatments. The paralysis and parasitism rates of H. hebetor were the highest at 2, 5, and 10-d old in all treatments. The results of this study suggest that H. hebetor females up to 10-d old can be used as an efficient biological control agent against E. elutella. The data of this study can also be used to predict the efficacy of different aged H. hebetor females in controlling E. elutella populations.',\n",

Subjects consisted of 75 patients with a class III skeletal relationship (ANB < 2° and overjet < 0 mm) who had been consecutively treated with rapid maxillary expansion and facemask and followed until their second phase treatment. The patients were divided into two groups according to whether they showed relapse in follow-up. The stable group maintained their positive overjet (n = 55), and the unstable group experienced relapse with a zero or negative overjet (n = 20). Two general, three dental, and 13 cephalometric pretreatment factors were investigated to determine which factors were associated with stability.,Sex, pretreatment age, and anteroposterior functional shift, which were hypothesized as associated factors, were not related to the stability of early class III treatment. Significant differences were detected between the two groups in the horizontal distance between the maxillary and mandibular molars in centric relation. Cephalometric variables, such as the mandibular length (Ar-Me), Wits appraisal, SN to ramus plane angle (SN-Rm), gonial angle, incisor mandibular plane angle (IMPA), and Frankfort plane to mandibular incisor angle (FMIA) showed significant differences between the groups. The horizontal distance was the most influential factor by logistic regression analysis.,Hypothesis (related to sex, age, functional shift) were rejected. Several cephalometric factors related to the mandible were associated with stability. The horizontal distance between the maxillary and mandibular molars in centric relation was the best predictor of early class III treatment relapse.',\n",

              " 'Constructed wetlands (CWs) are characterized by low construction cost, convenient maintenance and management, and environmentally friendly features. They have emerged as promising technologies for decentralized sewage treatment across rural areas. Source separation of black water and gray water can facilitate sewage recycling and reuse of reclaimed water, reduce the size of treatment facilities, and lower infrastructure investment and operating cost. This is consistent with the concept of sustainable development. However, black water contains high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen, and the denitrification capacity of CWs is not excellent due to insufficient carbon source. Therefore, application of CWs for black water treatment faces challenges. This article provides a review on the progress in CWs for treatment of the sewage with high-influent nitrogen load, with emphasis on the commonly used strengthening means and the role of plants in nitrogen removal via CWs. The current issues of rural sewage treatment with high-influent nitrogen load by CWs are also assessed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are discussed for the optimization of CWs-enhanced denitrification strategies.',\n",

This study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of oregano juice as a disinfection of hatching layer eggs as an alternative to formaldehyde. In the study, 1800 eggs collected from 48-week old Akbay white layer breeders were used. Eggs were divided into 3 equal disinfection groups (fumigation with formaldehyde, 50% oregano juice, and 100% oregano juice). In the study, the characteristics of the eggshell, microbial load, embryo development, egg weight loss, hatching results, chick weight and quality, and performance in the first 2\\xa0weeks were determined. No differences were observed among the disinfection groups in egg shell characteristics, microbial load in the shell, hatchability of fertile and set eggs, embryonic deaths, and body weight, body weight gain, and feed conversion ratio in female chicks. Egg weight loss was higher (P < 0.001) in the 50% oregano juice group (13.75%) compared to the formaldehyde fumigation group (12.11%). Chick quality score was found to be lower in the formaldehyde fumigation group (96.44) compared to the other two oregano juice groups (P < 0.001). The chicks hatched from the eggs in the formaldehyde fumigation group consumed more feed (119\\xa0g/week) in the first 2\\xa0weeks (P < 0.001). The use of 50% oregano juice in the disinfection of hatching eggs did not have any negative effects compared to the fumigation process with formaldehyde. Therefore, it is concluded that disinfection with 50% oregano juice was effective in reducing the microbial load in the egg shell as much as formaldehyde fumigation, and even it was superior in chick quality score.',\n",

The development and use of renewable energy sources is necessary and important in order to avoid the emergence of a global economic crisis. One of the solution to prevent a future crisis caused by energy shortages is to introduce biofuels into the fuel market. Despite the fact that various forms of renewable energy are currently used, the prospects for the production of biofuels from cyanobacteria are quite high due to their unique properties, such as a high lipid content and a suitable fatty acid (FA) composition for the production of biofuels, their suitability for growing open water and the ability to grow on wastewater. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the potential of cyanobacteria in the conversion of wastewater into biofuels. The article covers comparative data on the accumulation of lipids and the content of fatty acids in various representatives of cyanobacteria and their possibilities in the remediation of wastewater. Various approaches to the extraction of lipids from phototrophic microorganisms that are currently available, their advantages and disadvantages, and the results of the monitoring of the main key points of the development of the technology for converting cyanobacterial biomass into biofuels, with an emphasis on the existing barriers, effects and solutions, are also considered.

              " \"The diagnosis of dementia relies on the presence of new-onset cognitive impairment affecting an individual's functioning and activities of daily living. The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) is a questionnaire instrument, completed by a suitable 'informant' who knows the patient well, designed to assess change in functional performance secondary to cognitive change; it is used as a tool for identifying those who may have dementia. In secondary care there are two specific instances where patients may be assessed for the presence of dementia. These are in the general acute hospital setting, where opportunistic screening may be undertaken, or in specialist memory services where individuals have been referred due to perceived cognitive problems. To ensure an instrument is suitable for diagnostic use in these settings, its test accuracy must be established.,To determine the accuracy of the informant-based questionnaire IQCODE for detection of dementia in a secondary care setting.,We searched the following sources on the 28th of January 2013: ALOIS (Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), BIOSIS Previews (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), Web of Science Core Collection (includes Conference Proceedings Citation Index) (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and LILACS (BIREME). We also searched sources specific to diagnostic test accuracy: MEDION (Universities of Maastricht and Leuven); DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects - via the Cochrane Library); HTA Database (Health Technology Assessment Database via the Cochrane Library) and ARIF (Birmingham University). We also checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews, used searches of known relevant studies in PubMed to track related articles, and contacted research groups conducting work on IQCODE for dementia diagnosis to try to find additional studies. We developed a sensitive search strategy; search terms were designed to cover key concepts using several different approaches run in parallel and included terms relating to cognitive tests, cognitive screening and dementia. We used standardised database subject headings such as MeSH terms (in MEDLINE) and other standardised headings (controlled vocabulary) in other databases, as appropriate.,We selected those studies performed in secondary-care settings, which included (not necessarily exclusively) IQCODE to assess for the presence of dementia and where dementia diagnosis was confirmed with clinical assessment. For the 'secondary care' setting we included all studies which assessed patients in hospital (e.g. acute unscheduled admissions, referrals to specialist geriatric assessment services etc.) and those referred for specialist 'memory' assessment, typically in psychogeriatric services.,We screened all titles generated by electronic database searches, and reviewed abstracts of all potentially relevant studies. Two independent assessors checked full papers for eligibility and extracted data. We determined quality assessment (risk of bias and applicability) using the QUADAS-2 tool, and reporting quality using the STARD tool.,From 72 papers describing IQCODE test accuracy, we included 13 papers, representing data from 2745 individuals (n = 1413 (51%) with dementia). Pooled analysis of all studies using data presented closest to a cut-off of 3.3 indicated that sensitivity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.94); specificity 0.66 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.75); the positive likelihood ratio was 2.7 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.6) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.14 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.22). There was a statistically significant difference in test accuracy between the general hospital setting and the specialist memory setting (P = 0.019), suggesting that IQCODE performs better in a 'general' setting. We found no significant differences in the test accuracy of the short (16-item) versus the 26-item IQCODE, or in the language of administration. There was significant heterogeneity in the included studies, including a highly varied prevalence of dementia (10.5% to 87.4%). Across the included papers there was substantial potential for bias, particularly around sampling of included participants and selection criteria, which may limit generalisability. There was also evidence of suboptimal reporting, particularly around disease severity and handling indeterminate results, which are important if considering use in clinical practice.,The IQCODE can be used to identify older adults in the general hospital setting who are at risk of dementia and require specialist assessment; it is useful specifically for ruling out those without evidence of cognitive decline. The language of administration did not affect test accuracy, which supports the cross-cultural use of the tool. These findings are qualified by the significant heterogeneity, the potential for bias and suboptimal reporting found in the included studies.\",\n",

Instruments that use collateral sources to assess change in cognitive function over time may have particular utility. The most commonly used informant dementia assessment is the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). A synthesis of the available data regarding IQCODE accuracy will help inform cognitive assessment strategies for clinical practice, research and policy.,Our primary obective was to determine the accuracy of the informant-based questionnaire IQCODE for detection of dementia within community dwelling populations. Our secondary objective was to describe the effect of heterogeneity on the summary estimates.\\xa0We were particularly interested in the traditional 26-item scale versus the 16-item short form; and language of administration. We explored the effect of varying the threshold IQCODE score used to define 'test positivity'.,We searched the following sources on 28 January 2013: ALOIS (Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), BIOSIS Previews (ISI Web of Knowledge), Web of Science with Conference Proceedings (ISI Web of Knowledge), LILACS (BIREME).

Our intention with limiting the search to a 'community' setting was to include those studies closest to population level assessment. Within our predefined community inclusion criteria, there were relevant papers that fulfilled our definition of community dwelling but represented a selected population, for example stroke survivors. We included these studies but performed sensitivity analyses to assess the effects of these less representative populations on the summary results.,We screened all titles generated by the electronic database searches and abstracts of all potentially relevant studies were reviewed. Full papers were assessed for eligibility and data extracted by two independent assessors.\\xa0For quality assessment (risk of bias and applicability) we used the QUADAS 2 tool. We included test accuracy data on the IQCODE used at predefined diagnostic thresholds.\\xa0Where data allowed, we performed meta-analyses to calculate summary values of sensitivity and specificity with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We pre-specified analyses to describe the effect of IQCODE format (traditional or short form) and language of administration for the IQCODE.,From 16,144 citations, 71 papers described IQCODE test accuracy. We included 10 papers (11 independent datasets) representing data from 2644 individuals (n = 379 (14%) with dementia). Using IQCODE cut-offs commonly employed in clinical practice (3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6) the sensitivity and specificity of IQCODE for diagnosis of dementia across the studies were generally above 75%. Taking an IQCODE threshold of 3.3 (or closest available) the sensitivity was 0.80 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.85); specificity was 0.84 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.90); positive likelihood ratio was 5.2 (95% CI 3.7 to 7.5) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.23 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.29). Comparative analysis suggested no significant difference in the test accuracy of the 16 and 26-item IQCODE tests and no significant difference in test accuracy by language of administration. There was little difference in sensitivity across our predefined diagnostic cut-points. There was substantial heterogeneity in the included studies. Sensitivity analyses removing potentially unrepresentative populations in these studies made little difference to the pooled data estimates. The majority of included papers had potential for bias, particularly around participant selection and sampling. The quality of reporting was suboptimal particularly regarding timing of assessments and descriptors of reproducibility and inter-observer variability.,Published data suggest that if using the IQCODE for community dwelling older adults, the 16 item IQCODE may be preferable to the traditional scale due to lesser test burden and no obvious difference in accuracy. Although IQCODE test accuracy is in a range that many would consider 'reasonable', in the context of community or population settings the use of the IQCODE alone would result in substantial misdiagnosis and false reassurance. Across the included studies there were issues with heterogeneity, several potential biases and suboptimal reporting quality.\",\n",

The paper described those patients consulting a primary care service who self-identified as Japanese-American. Dementia diagnosis was made using Benson & Cummings criteria and the IQCODE was recorded as part of a longer interview with the informant. IQCODE accuracy was assessed at various test thresholds, with a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity across these cutpoints. At an IQCODE threshold of 3.2 sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 76%; for IQCODE 3.7 sensitivity: 75%, specificity: 98%. Applying the QUADAS-2 assessments, the study was at high risk of bias in all categories. In particular degree of blinding was unclear and not all participants were included in the final analysis.,It is not possible to give definitive guidance on the test accuracy of IQCODE for the diagnosis of dementia in a primary care setting based on the single study identified. We are surprised by the lack of research using the IQCODE in primary care as this is, arguably, the most appropriate setting for targeted case finding of those with undiagnosed dementia in order to maximise opportunities to intervene and provide support for the individual and their carers.',\n",

The petitioner also sought directions to the Union government for setting up of separate vaccination centres for pregnant women who are at high risk, and the creation of a registry for monitoring their medical condition post vaccination (1). The case was a pivotal point in the history of Covid-19 vaccine rollouts in India, because it demanded a clear communication from the Union Government for vaccination of pregnant women. The Union Government's counsel informed the Court that while the Government would consider the May 28 recommendations of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) in favour of vaccinations for all pregnant women based on a risk vs benefit assessment, no timeline was in place for this yet (2). Based on this statement, the Court disposed of the petition, passing no further orders.\",\n",

It shows how the community's distrust of the researcher as an agent of a malevolent government (expressed in a refusal to sign the consent form) is reflected in the researcher's objective links to government through education and advanced academic research. Arguing that research ethics rather than blindly following rules, means thinking about context, it reverses the question of relevance of the ethics protocol, to questioning the relevance of the research to the community. It suggests that thinking this through will clarify the position of the researcher and contribute to research ethics.

              " 'Convalescent plasma therapy emerged as an early experimental therapy for the treatment of Covid-19. However, despite limited data regarding its safety and efficacy, the therapy was extensively publicised by multiple politicians as a cure. We analyse the impact of this political narrative around medical therapeutics on the pandemic using the coherentist model of public health ethics. The clinical benefits of the therapy are evaluated in terms of reduction in mortality and disease progression as compared to the potential transfusion-related adverse events. Political advocacy of therapeutics might hamper the autonomy and decision-making of individuals and institutions. Marketing and monetisation of convalescent plasma might cause inequitable distribution and unregulated use. It also creates an economic burden on the government and healthcare which should be justified by the additional cost/effectiveness ratio of the therapy. This article exemplifies the inadvertent effects and ethical challenges following political narratives about medical therapeutics and the importance of involving ethics in designing policies concerning public healthcare.',\n",

One key social consequence of the infection has been the stigma associated with it.,This study was conducted to explore the lived experiences of stigma among persons who have recovered from Covid-19 in Chennai, India.,In depth telephonic interviews were conducted among 12 persons who had recovered from Covid-19 in Chennai. The participants were encouraged to narrate their experiences of stigma. The telephonic interviews were transcribed and coded by both the researchers. The codes were then grouped into meaningful themes and the lived experiences of stigma described with the help of rich narrative quotes.,The common manifestations of stigma were exclusion from public spaces and essential services, loss of livelihood, loss of social support and, in an extreme case, physical violence. The stigma was also manifested in health facilities in the form of neglect, and rude and insensitive treatment of patients. The factors that aggravated the stigma included fear of infection, lack of information, legitimisation of segregation by forced public health interventions, involvement of police in contact tracing, and isolation. Stigma was associated with psychosocial consequences such as loneliness, uncertainty, anxiety, anger, and humiliation. Demonstration of empathy, advances in communication technology, solidarity in communities and protecting confidentiality could potentially mitigate stigma. The intersectionality of age, gender, poverty, and disability worsened the experience of stigma.,People who had recovered from Covid-19 experienced various degrees of social stigma. The future impact of the pandemic will depend strongly on the ability of health systems to address stigma.',\n",

              " 'All over the world, we see cases of violation of the code of ethical conduct by health professionals and students, leading to distrust between them and their patients. Institutions need to prioritise the training of students in biomedical ethics. Students face a variety of ethical issues throughout their course of study. Issues tend to vary from the pre-clinical years to the clinical years, depending upon the exposure to patients and teaching standards practised in institutions. There appears to be a gap between ethical issues discussed in classrooms and those faced by students in real life. Here we intend to provide a brief overview of the ethical responsibilities of a medical student in varied contexts. Knowing what their moral duties are will sensitise students to fundamental ethical principles in the medical field and lessen the gap between what is taught and what they will encounter in practice. Moreover, it will draw the attention of teachers towards the need to provide quality training in biomedical ethics.',\n",
              " \"India's nationwide lockdown to curtail the transmission of Covid-19 has given rise to concerns over the health system's response to maternal and child health (MCH) services. This paper aims to understand the challenges faced by pregnant women seeking institutional care during the lockdown. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of 54 online news reports, published in English and Hindi, between 25 March 2020 and 31 May 2020. They covered cases across 17 states in India and 16 maternal deaths. Three broad thematic categories of challenges for pregnant women emerged from the analysis: 1) physical access to health facilities, 2) admission to health facilities, and 3) lack of respectful maternity care during the lockdown. In conclusion, strengthening health systems and incorporating MCH into the Covid-19 response is imperative. Failure to provide quality MCH services during the lockdown has implications for the continuum of women's care, maternal mortality, and human rights.\",\n",

The availability of technologically advanced treatments for infertility provides hope to couples, especially women, to resolve the demeaning identities assigned to them, related to infertility. The paper focuses on the moral dilemma faced by a medically trained public health professional while collecting data from women in Kerala who were unable to continue the suggested biomedical treatment. Infertility treatment is an entropic cycle of success and failure; thus, the women studied moved from one stage to another hoping for a resolution to their problem.

Owing to the ubiquitous presence of smartphones, their use in mHealth PA interventions seems obvious; nevertheless, there are gaps in the literature on the evaluation reporting processes and best practices of such interventions.,The primary objective of this review is to analyze the development and evaluation trajectory of smartphone-based mHealth PA interventions and to review systematic theory- and evidence-based practices and methods that are implemented along this trajectory. The secondary objective is to identify the range of evidence (both quantitative and qualitative) available on smartphone-based mHealth PA interventions to provide a comprehensive tabular and narrative review of the available literature in terms of its nature, features, and volume.,We conducted a scoping review of qualitative and quantitative studies examining smartphone-based PA interventions published between 2008 and 2018. In line with scoping review guidelines, studies were not rejected based on their research design or quality. This review, therefore, includes experimental and descriptive studies, as well as reviews addressing smartphone-based mHealth interventions aimed at promoting PA in all age groups (with a subanalysis conducted for adolescents). Two groups of studies were additionally included: reviews or content analyses of PA trackers and meta-analyses exploring behavior change techniques and their efficacy.,Included articles (N=148) were categorized into 10 groups: commercial smartphone app content analyses, smartphone-based intervention review studies, activity tracker content analyses, activity tracker review studies, meta-analyses of PA intervention studies, smartphone-based intervention studies, qualitative formative studies, app development descriptive studies, qualitative follow-up studies, and other related articles. Only 24 articles targeted children or adolescents (age range: 5-19 years). There is no agreed evaluation framework or taxonomy to code or report smartphone-based PA interventions. Researchers did not state the coding method, used various evaluation frameworks, or used different versions of behavior change technique taxonomies. In addition, there is no consensus on the best behavior change theory or model that should be used in smartphone-based interventions for PA promotion. Commonly reported systematic practices and methods have been successfully identified. They include PA recommendations, trial designs (randomized controlled trials, experimental trials, and rapid design trials), mixed methods data collection (surveys, questionnaires, interviews, and focus group discussions), scales to assess app quality, and industry-recognized reporting guidelines.,Smartphone-based mHealth interventions aimed at promoting PA showed promising results for behavior change. Although there is a plethora of published studies on the adult target group, the number of studies and consequently the evidence base for adolescents is limited. Overall, the efficacy of smartphone-based mHealth PA interventions can be considerably improved through a more systematic approach of developing, reporting, and coding of the interventions.',\n",

JSANDS was implemented and tested in 5 maternity hospitals during the period spanning May 2019 through December 2020.,This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness and performance of JSANDS to register births, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths, and determine their causes. Specifically, this study examined the JSANDS attributes of acceptability, simplicity, flexibility, stability, representativeness, sustainability, penetration, data quality, sensitivity, and adoption.,An evaluation study was conducted after 18 months of the JSANDS implementation using the Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems. The evaluation focused on how well the system operated to meet its purpose and objectives. The indicators assessing the system attributes were scored on a Likert scale. Each indicator and overall attribute percentage score was represented as score rank and interpreted as excellent (score =80%), good (score =60 and <80%), average (score =40 and <60%), and poor (score <40%).,A total of 270 health care professionals participated in this study and evaluated the system performance. The system users rated the usefulness of JSANDS as excellent (percentage score=85.6%). The overall acceptability (percentage score=82.3%), flexibility (percentage score=80.2%), stability (percentage score=80.0%), and representativeness (percentage score=86.6%) were also rated excellent. The overall simplicity was scored good (percentage score=75.4%). All participants were trained on JSANDS and used it in the past 12 months. Of the 270 respondents, 219 (86.2%) reported that they intend to continue using the JSANDS system to register neonatal deaths and stillbirths in the future. All variables in JSANDS had complete data with no missing values.,The performance of JSANDS in registering all stillbirths and neonatal deaths as well as their causes was excellent. Almost all attributes and indicators of JSANDS functionality were rated excellent. JSANDS can be scaled up to cover all maternity hospitals in Jordan. The potential for scaling up the system is very high for many reasons, including its usefulness, simplified stillbirth and neonatal death review tools, and ease of the reporting process.',\n",

However, there is a paucity in our knowledge regarding recommendations for mobile apps specific to health care professionals.,The aim of this study is to establish a validated instrument to assess mobile apps for health care providers and health systems. Our objective is to create and validate a tool that evaluates mobile health apps aimed at health care professionals based on a trust, utility, and interest scale.,A five-step methodology framework guided our approach. The first step consisted of building a scale to evaluate apps for health care professionals based on a literature review. This was followed with expert panel validation through a Delphi method of (rated) web-based questionnaires to empirically evaluate the inclusion and weight of the indicators identified through the literature review. Repeated iterations were followed until a consensus greater than 75% was reached. The scale was then tested using a pilot to assess reliability. Interrater agreement of the pilot was measured using a weighted Cohen kappa.,Using a literature review, a first draft of the scale was developed. This was followed with two Delphi rounds between the local research group and an external panel of experts. After consensus was reached, the resulting ISYScore-Pro 17-item scale was tested. A total of 280 apps were originally identified for potential testing (140 iOS apps and 140 Android apps). These were categorized using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. Once duplicates were removed and they were downloaded to confirm their specificity to the target audience (ie, health care professionals), 66 remained. Of these, only 18 met the final criteria for inclusion in validating the ISYScore-Pro scale (interrator reliabilty 92.2%; kappa 0.840, 95% CI 0.834-0.847; P<.001).,We have developed a reproducible methodology to objectively evaluate mobile health apps targeted to health care professionals and providers, the ISYScore-Pro scale. Future research will be needed to adapt the scale to other languages and across other domains (eg, legal compliance or security).',\n",

              " 'Over the years, there have been significant advances in oncology. However, the rate that therapeutics come to market has increased, while the strength of evidence has decreased. Currently, there is limited understanding about how these uncertainties are managed in provincial funding decisions for cancer therapeutics. We conducted qualitative interviews with six senior officials from four different Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Quebec, and Ontario) and a document review of the uncertainties found in submissions to the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR). Participants reported considerable uncertainty related to a lack of solid clinical evidence (early-phase clinical trials: generalizability, immature data, and the use of unvalidated surrogate outcomes). Proposed strategies to deal with the uncertainty included risk-sharing agreements, collection of real-world evidence (RWE), and ongoing collaboration between federal groups and provinces. The document review added to the reported uncertainties by classifying them into five main categories: trial validity, population, comparators, outcomes, and intervention. This study highlights how decision makers must deal with significant amounts of uncertainty in funding decisions for cancer drugs, most of which stems from methodological limitations in clinical trials. There is a critical need for transparent priority-setting processes and mechanisms to reevaluate drugs to ensure benefit given the high level of uncertainty of novel therapeutics.',\n",

This exploratory study evaluated the expression of molecular CSC markers in different tissues of HNSCC patients. Tissue specimens of primary tumor, lymph node metastases and macroscopically healthy mucosa of 12 consecutive HNSCC patients, that were treated with surgery and adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy upon indication, were collected. Samples were assessed for the expression of p16 as a surrogate for HPV-related disease and different molecular stem cell markers (ALDH1A1, BCL11B, BMI-1, and CD44). In the cohort, seven patients had HPV-related HNSCC; six thereof were oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. While expression of BMI-1 and BCL11B was significantly lower in healthy mucosa than both tumor and lymph node metastasis, there were no differences between tumor and lymph node metastasis. In the HPV-positive sub-cohort, these differences remained significant for BMI-1. However, no significant differences in these three tissues were found for ALDH1A1 and CD44. In conclusion, this exploratory study shows that CSC markers BMI-1 and BCL11B discriminate between healthy and cancerous tissue, whereas ALDH1A1 and CD44 were expressed to a comparable extent in healthy mucosa and cancerous tissues.',\n",

Canadian directors of palliative care programs were surveyed with respect to interdisciplinary integration. Participants responded in writing or by phone interview. We operationalized reports of interdisciplinary professions as either present or under/not-represented. The Vaismoradi, Turunen, and Bondas' procedure was used for content analysis. Our 14 participants consisted of physicians (85.7%), nurses (14.3%), and a social worker (7.1%) from Ontario (35.7%), British Columbia (14.3%), Alberta (14.3%), Quebec (14.3%), Nova Scotia (14.3%), and New Brunswick (7.1%). Psychology and social work were equally and most frequently reported as under/not represented (5/14, each). All participants reported the presence of medical professionals (physicians and nurses) and these groups were not reported as under/not represented. Spiritual care and others (e.g., rehabilitation and volunteers) were infrequently reported as under/not represented. Qualitative themes included Commonly Represented Disciplines, Quality of Multidisciplinary Collaboration, Commonly Under-Represented Disciplines, and Special Concern: Psychosocial Care. Similar to previous reports, we found that (1) psychology was under-represented yet highly valued and (2) despite social work's relative high presence in care, our participants reported a higher need for more. These finding highlight those psychosocial gaps in care are most frequently noted by palliative care professionals, especially psychology and social work.

              " \"The pelvis is a common site of metastatic bone disease. Peri-acetabular lesions are particularly challenging and can cause severe pain, disability and pathologic fractures. Surgical management of these lesions has historically consisted of cementoplasty for contained lesions and Harrington reconstructions for larger, more destructive lesions. Due to the limitations of these procedures, a number of novel procedures have been developed to manage this challenging problem. Percutaneous techniques-including acetabular screw fixation and cementoplasty augmented with screws-have been developed to minimize surgical morbidity. Recent literature has demonstrated a reliable reduction in pain and improvement in function in appropriately selected patients. Several adjuncts to the Harrington procedure have been utilized in recent years to reduce complication rates. The use of constrained liners and dual mobility bearings have reduced the historically high dislocation rates. Cage constructs and porous tantalum implants are becoming increasingly common in the management of large bony defects and destructive lesions. With novel and evolving surgical techniques, surgeons are presented with a variety of surgical options to manage this challenging condition. Physicians must take into account the patients' overall health status, oncologic prognosis and anatomic location and extent of disease when developing an appropriate surgical plan.\",\n",

Activity, sitting time, adherence to Mediterranean diet and BC were measured.,Regarding BC, only 5% and 10.7% of the subjects had health risk values for waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio, respectively. The mean daily sitting-time was 8.26 hours, while 19.64% of the subjects spent . 10 hours per day sitting. 92.86% of the subjects complied with the World Health Organization 2020 physical activity recommendations. The mean PREDIMED score was 7.41, while 51.8% of the subjects had low adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Regarding HrQoL, 22 subjects (39.2%) and 26 subjects (46.4%) were in the lowest quintile of physical component summary and mental component summary, respectively, according to the reference values for their age range. There was a negative correlation between physical function and sitting time (r = -0.38).,There were high levels of sedentary behavior and low HrQoL values, with a negative moderate correlation between these variables. The findings from the present study especially highlight the importance of implementing public health programs targeting reduction of sitting time among university students.',\n",
              " 'To assess the perception of Latin American ophthalmology practitioners regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure risk, knowledge about personal protection measures, and prioritization of patients.,Self-administered voluntary anonymous survey (Google Drive forms) was distributed via text message to ophthalmology practitioners from May 01 to May 05, 2020.,Three hundred seventy-one practitioners (45% response rate) comprising 118 (27.6%) residents, 111 (40.5%) ophthalmologists, and 142 (32.8%) sub-specialists completed the survey. Among them, 106 (32.6%) thought that they were at a high risk of acquiring COVID-19 during the course of work. Furthermore, 273 (69.1%) believed that the current guidelines were insufficient to identify COVID-19 patients. The survey also revealed that 265 (59.5%) were not trained to use personal protective equipment (PPE), and even with its correct use, 341 (91.5%) still felt that they were at risk of acquiring COVID-19. Moreover, 80% of the respondents were of the view that staff members were not knowledgeable about national protocols for attending COVID-19 patients. However, only 9 (2%) considered changing their profession to ameliorate COVID-19 contagion risk.,This survey has revealed the issues faced by ophthalmology practitioners in Latin America during their routine practice. These concerns and anxiety about COVID- 19 pandemic seem to be the same worldwide. It is important to reinforce the confidence of ophthalmology practitioners on current guidelines for attending COVID-19 patients. It is also necessary to conduct training programs on PPE usage and ensure that PPE items are available at all times to enhance the quality of care and minimize the spread of the disease.',\n",
              " 'Lupus retinopathy is a clinical manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus in the visual system. It is generally asymptomatic; however, it can become a threatening condition. It is closely associated with the inflammatory activity and higher mortality of systemic lupus erythematosus. Lupus retinopathy has several different clinical presentations, such as lupus microangiopathy, vascular occlusion, vasculitis, hypertensive retinopathy associated with lupus nephritis, and autoimmune retinopathy. Although the prevalence and associated factors of lupus retinopathy have been well defined in some parts of the world, there are no data from Latin America, including Brazil. As lupus retinopathy is generally asymptomatic, without a routine fundoscopy, it has been probably underestimated. This review is intended to discuss the epidemiology and risk factors of lupus retinopathy.',\n",
              " 'A research was conducted to evaluate the impact of various nitrogen and phosphorus levels along with beneficial microbes to enhance canola productivity. The research was carried out at Agronomy Research Farm, The University of Agriculture Peshawar in winter 2016-2017. The experiment was conducted in randomized complete block factorial design. The study was comprised of three factors including nitrogen (60, 120 and 180 kg ha-1), phosphorous (70, 100 and 130 kg ha-1) and beneficial microbes (with and without BM). A control treatment with no N, P and BM was also kept for comparison. Application of beneficial microbes significantly increased pods plant, seed pod, seed filling duration, 1000 seed weight, biological yield and seed yield as compared to control plots. Nitrogen applied at the rate of 180 kg ha-1 increased pods plant-1, seed pod, seed filling duration, seed weight, biological yield and seed yield. Maximum pods plant-1, seed pod, early seed filling, heavier seed weight, biological yield, seed yield, and harvest index were observed in plots treated with 130 kg.ha-1 phosphorous. As comparison, the combine treated plots have more pods plant-1, seeds pod-1, seed filling duration, heaviest seeds, biological yield, seed yield and harvest index as compared to control plots. It is concluded that application of beneficial microbes with N and P at the rate of 180 kg ha-1 and 130 kg ha-1, respectively, increased yield and its attributes for canola.',\n",
              " 'The Indian Crested Porcupine (Hystrix indica) is classified as an agricultural pest species. It feeds on plants and crops; hence, it is responsible for massive financial losses worldwide. The current study was conducted to assess the diet composition of Indian Crested Porcupine in District Bagh, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJ&K). Thus, fecal samples were collected and examined from different sampling sites. Reference slides of the material collected from the study area were prepared for identification of dietary components in fecal pellets. A total of 80 fecal samples were collected and processed. Percent relative frequencies (P.R.F.) were calculated for each plant species recovered from pellets. Data revealed that Indian Crested Porcupine consumed 31 plant species in its diet, among them Zea mays (34.31±7.76) was the most frequently selected species followed by Rumex obtusifolius (15.32±2.57) and Melia azedarach (12.83±4.79). The study revealed that the greatest diversity of (n=20) plant species were consumed in summer season while minimum (n=13) species were used during winter. Among the parts of plants, stem was highly consumed in spring (57.2%) as compared to seed in fall (36.7%) while spikes and leaf were the least recovered parts from the fecal matter. The Berger-Parker diversity index showed highly diversified food (10.92) in the summer time of the year as compared to the autumn season (2.95). This study provides a baseline for the diet preference of this pest in the study area. Based on current findings, a detailed investigation on damage assessment, exploration, habitat use and management of Indian Crested Porcupine in AJ&K has been recommended.',\n",

The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was proposed as a marker of systemic inflammatory response and survival in patients with cirrhosis.,Evaluate the prognostic role of NLR in cirrhotic patients and its relation with inflammatory cytokines(IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17).,In this prospective study two groups were evaluated: 1) Stable cirrhotic in outpatient follow-up (n=193); 2) Hospitalized cirrhotic for acute decompensation for at least 48 hours (n=334) with admission and 48 hours tests evaluation. Circulating inflammatory cytokines were available for 130 hospitalized patients.,In outpatients with stable cirrhosis, NLR correlated with MELD score and other variables associated with severity of disease. However, after a median of 32 months of follow up NLR was not associated with mortality (HR 1.058, 95%CI 0.900-1.243; P=0.495). In hospitalized patients, NLR at 48-hour after admission was independently associated with 90-day survival (HR 1.061, 95%CI 1.020-1.103; P=0.003) in multivariate Cox-regression analysis. The 90-day Kaplan-Meier survival probability was 87% for patients with a 48-hour NLR <3.6 and 62% for NLR =3.6 (P<0.001). Elevation of NLR in the first 48 hours was also independently associated with mortality (HR 2.038, 95%CI 1295-3207; P=0.002). The 90-day Kaplan-Meier survival probability was 83% when NLR did not increase and 62% when NLR increased (P<0.001). IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17 at admission were positively correlated with both admission and 48-hour NLR. Lower levels of baseline IL-10 were associated with NLR increase during first 48-hour.,NLR evaluated at 48 hours of hospitalization and its early increase after admission were independently associated with short-term mortality in patients hospitalized for acute decompensation of cirrhosis.',\n",

Intestinal dysbiosis may be associated with a higher risk of esophageal lesions, mainly due to changes in gastroesophageal motility patterns, elevation of intra-abdominal pressure, and increased frequency of transient relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter.,The aim of this study was to evaluate the intestinal microbiota in individuals with erosive esophagitis and in healthy individuals using metagenomics.,A total of 22 fecal samples from adults aged between 18 and 60 years were included. Eleven individuals had esophagitis (eight men and three women) and 11 were healthy controls (10 men and one woman). The individuals were instructed to collect and store fecal material into a tube containing guanidine solution. The DNA of the microbiota was extracted from each fecal samples and PCR amplification was performed using primers for the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The amplicons were sequenced using the Ion Torrent PGM platform and the data were analyzed using the QIIME™ software version 1.8. Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test and the ANOSIM non-parametric method based on distance matrix.,The alpha-diversity and beta-diversity indices were similar between the two groups, without statistically significant differences. There was no statistically significant difference in the phylum level. However, a statistically significant difference was observed in the abundance of the family Clostridiaceae (0.3% vs 2.0%, P=0.032) and in the genus Faecaliumbacterium (10.5% vs 4.5%, P=0.045) between healthy controls and esophagitis patients.,The findings suggest that reduced abundance of the genus Faecaliumbacterium and greater abundance of the family Clostridiaceae may be risk factors for the development of erosive esophagitis. Intervention in the composition of the intestinal microbiota should be considered as an adjunct to current therapeutic strategies for this clinical condition.',\n",

Therefore, sphincter preserving techniques are gaining more popularity.,The aim of the study was to assess effectiveness of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy in the patients with recurrent cryptoglandular anal fistulas.,A cohort of 18 patients with anal fistulas was enrolled into a preliminary and prospective trial. They were divided into two groups consisting of eight and ten patients respectively. PRP was injected locally in all patients, however in the group II it was applied after 7 days drainage of fistulas with polyurethane foam or negative pressure wound therapy. On average, three doses of PRP were administered, but with the opportunity to double the number of applications if it was clinically justified. The patients were evaluated in an out-patient department after fortnight and then in 1, 6, and 12 months following the last PRP application.,Anal fistulas were closed in 4 (50%) patients from the group I and in 7 (70%) patients form the group II. Although, the difference between both groups was not statistically significant, PRP therapy should be preceded with fistulous tract drainage in all patients. Summarizing, that successful result was achieved in 11 (60%) patients from the entire group of 18 participants.,The rate of recurrent cryptoglandular anal fistulas closure reaching 60%, after topical treatment with PRP, exceeds the results of other sphincter-saving methods of treatment. Therefore, it might become a novel method of anal fistulas therapy.',\n",

Given how rare PSC is in childhood, until the recent publication of a multicenter international collaboration, even data on its characteristics and natural history were scarce. Symptomatic cholelithiasis has not been previously reported as the presentation of PSC.,The aim of this study was the diagnosis of PSC following the initial unusual presentation with symptomatic cholelithiasis, that followed an atypical clinical course that could not be explained by cholelithiasis alone. A literature review was also conducted.,We conducted a retrospective chart review of three patients, who were diagnosed and/or followed at the Clinics Hospital, University of Campinas - Sao Paulo/ Brazil, between 2014 and 2020. Data analyzed included gender, age of presentation, past medical history, imaging findings, laboratory results, endoscopic evaluation, response to medical therapy and follow-up.,Age at time of presentation with cholelithiasis varied from 10 to 12 years. In two of the cases reported, a more subacute onset of symptoms preceded the episode of cholelithiasis. Two patients were managed with cholecystectomy, not followed by any surgical complications, one patient was managed conservatively. Percutaneous liver biopsy was performed in all three cases, showing histological findings compatible with PSC. Associated inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was not seen in any of the patients. The patients have been followed for a mean time of 3.4 years.,PSC and cholelithiasis are both rare in the pediatric population. This study reports on symptomatic cholelithiasis as a presentation of PSC and raises the importance of suspecting an underlying hepatobiliary disorder in children with cholelithiasis without any known predisposing factors and/or that follow an atypical clinical course for cholelithiasis alone.',\n",

              " 'Exercise intolerance is the hallmark consequence of advanced chronic heart failure (HF). The six-minute step test (6MST) has been considered an option for the six-minute walk test because it is safe, inexpensive, and can be applied in small places. However, its reliability and concurrent validity has still not been investigated in participants with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Clinically stable HFrEF participants were included. Reliability and error measurement were calculated by comparing the first with the second 6MST result. Forty-eight hours after participants underwent the 6MST, they were invited to perform a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) on a cycle ergometer. Concurrent validity was assessed by correlation between number of steps and peak oxygen uptake (V?O2 peak) at CPET. Twenty-seven participants with HFrEF (60±8 years old and left ventricle ejection fraction of 41±6%) undertook a mean of 94±30 steps in the 6MST. Intra-rater reliability was excellent for 6MST (ICC=0.9), with mean error of 4.85 steps and superior and inferior limits of agreement of 30.6 and -20.9 steps, respectively. In addition, strong correlations between number of steps and CPET workload (r=0.76, P<0.01) and peak V?O2 (r=0.71, P<0.01) were observed. From simple linear regression the following predictive equations were obtained with 6MST results: V?O2 peak (mL/min) = 350.22 + (7.333 × number of steps), with R2=0.51, and peak workload (W) = 4.044 + (0.772 × number of steps), with R2=0.58.

Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) has been found to contribute to VM formation. However, it remains largely unknown whether Cav-1 expression correlates with VM in glioma. In this study, we examined CAV-1 expression levels and VM in human glioma cell lines and in 94 human gliomas with different grades of malignancy, and present Cox proportional hazards regression. The molecular role of Cav-1 in glioma cells was investigated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays, western blotting, CCK-8 assays, and tubule formation assays. Cav-1 expression and VM formation were positively correlated with each other and both were closely associated with glioma development and progression as evidenced by the presence of cystic tumor, shortened survival time, and advanced-stage glioma in glioma patients with Cav-1 overexpression/increased VM formation. Cav-1 promoted U251 glioma cell proliferation and VM formation in a Matrigel-based 3D culture model. VM-associated factors including hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF-1a) and p-Akt was significantly elevated by Cav-1 overexpression but suppressed by siCav-1 in U251 cells. Collectively, our study identified Cav-1 as an important regulator of glioma cell proliferation and VM formation, contributing to glioma development and progression.',\n",

We tested the hypothesis that unsaturated high-fat diet (HFD) promotes myocardial dysfunction in OR rats, which it is related to Ca2+ handling. In addition, we questioned whether exercise training (ET) becomes a therapeutic strategy. Male Wistar rats (n=80) were randomized to standard or HFD diets for 20 weeks. The rats were redistributed for the absence or presence of ET and OR: control (C; n=12), control + ET (CET; n=14), obese-resistant (OR; n=9), and obese-resistant + ET (ORET; n=10). Trained rats were subjected to aerobic training protocol with progressive intensity (55-70% of the maximum running speed) and duration (15 to 60 min/day) for 12 weeks. Nutritional, metabolic, and cardiovascular parameters were determined. Cardiac function and Ca2+ handling tests were performed in isolated left ventricle (LV) papillary muscle. OR rats showed cardiac atrophy with reduced collagen levels, but there was myocardial dysfunction. ET was efficient in improving most parameters of body composition. However, the mechanical properties and Ca2+ handling from isolated papillary muscle were similar among groups. Aerobic ET does not promote morphological and cardiac functional adaptation under the condition of OR.',\n",
              " 'Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a type of glycosaminoglycan described as an antioxidant molecule that has been found in animal species such as fish. Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) represents an eco-friendly source of this compound, since its economical processing generates usable waste, reducing the negative environmental impact. This waste was used for CS extraction, purification, characterization by enzymatic degradation, and evaluation of its antioxidant effect. CS obtained from tilapia presented sulfation mainly at carbon 4 of galactosamine, and it was not cytotoxic at concentrations up to 200 µg/mL. Furthermore, 100 µg/mL of CS from tilapia reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species to 47% of the total intracellular reactive oxygen species level. The ability of CS to chelate metal ions in vitro also suggested an ability to react with other pathways that generate oxidative radicals, such as the Haber-Weiss reaction, acting intracellularly in more than one way. Although the role of CS from tilapia remains unclear, the pharmacological effects described herein indicate that CS is a potential molecule for further study of the relationship between the structures and functions of chondroitin sulfates as antioxidants.',\n",

This study performed the functional investigation of circRNA dehydrogenase E1 and transketolase domain containing 1 (circDHTKD1) in OSCC. RNA expression levels of different molecules were measured via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cellular behaviors were detected by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-y1)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) for cell viability, colony formation assay for clonal capacity, flow cytometry for cell apoptosis, wound healing assay for migration, and transwell assay for migration/invasion. Western blot was used for analyzing protein expression. RNA pull-down and dual-luciferase reporter assays were applied to assess the binding between targets. A xenograft tumor model was established in nude mice for in vivo experiments. Our expression analysis revealed that circDHTKD1 was upregulated in OSCC tissues and cells. circDHTKD1 knockdown was shown to impede OSCC cell growth and metastasis but motivate apoptosis. Additionally, circDHTKD1 served as a microRNA-326 (miR-326) sponge and the function of circDHTKD1 was achieved by sponging miR-326 in OSCC cells. Also, miR-326 inhibited OSCC development via targeting GRB2-associated-binding protein 1 (GAB1). circDHTKD1 could sponge miR-326 to alter GAB1 expression. Furthermore, circDHTKD1 contributed to OSCC progression in vivo via the miR-326/GAB1 axis. These data disclosed a specific circDHTKD1/miR-326/GAB1 signal axis in governing the malignant progression of OSCC, showing the considerable possibility of circDHTKD1 as a predictive and therapeutic target for clinical diagnosis and treatment of OSCC.',\n",

However, the mechanism underlying the anticancer effect of JCo extract on colorectal cancer (CRC) has not yet been elucidated. This study investigated the anticancer effects of JCo extract in vitro and in vivo as well as the precise molecular mechanisms. Cell viability was evaluated using the MTT assay. Cell cycle distribution was examined by flow cytometry analysis, and cell apoptosis was determined by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Protein expression was analyzed using western blotting. The in vivo activity of the JCo extract was evaluated using a xenograft BALB/c mouse model. The tumors and organs were examined through hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that JCo extract exhibited higher cytotoxicity against CRC cells than against normal cells and showed synergistic effects when combined with 5-fluorouracil. JCo extract induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase via regulation of p53/p21 and CDK4/cyclin D1 and induced cell apoptosis via the extrinsic (FasL/Fas/caspase-8) and intrinsic (Bax/Bcl-2/caspase-9) apoptotic pathways. In vivo studies revealed that JCo extract suppressed tumor growth through the inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. In addition, there was no obvious change in body weight or histological morphology of normal organs after treatment. JCo extract suppressed CRC progression by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, suggesting the potential application of JCo extract in the treatment of CRC.',\n",
              " 'Gender equity is far from being achieved in most academic institutions worldwide. Women representation in scientific leadership faces multiple obstacles. Implicit bias and stereotype threat are considered important driving forces concerning gender disparities. Negative cultural stereotypes of weak scientific performance, unrelated to true capacity, are implicitly associated with women and other social groups, influencing, without awareness, attitudes and judgments towards them. Meetings of scientific societies are the forum in which members from all stages of scientific careers are brought together. Visibility in the scientific community stems partly from presenting research as a speaker. Here, we investigated gender disparities in the Brazilian Society of Neuroscience and Behavior (SBNeC). Across the 15 mandates (1978-2020), women occupied 30% of the directory board posts, and only twice was a woman president. We evaluated six meetings held between 2010 and 2019. During this period, the membership of women outnumbered that of men in all categories. A total of 57.50% of faculty members, representing the potential pool of speakers and chairs, were female. Compared to this expected value, female speakers across the six meetings were scarce in full conferences (?2(5)=173.54, P<0.001) and low in symposia (?2(5)=36.92, P<0.001). Additionally, women chaired fewer symposia (?2(5)=47.83, P<0.001). Furthermore, men-chaired symposia had significantly fewer women speakers than women-chaired symposia (?2(1)=56.44, P<0.001). The gender disparities observed here are similar to those in other scientific societies worldwide, urging them to lead actions to pursue gender balance and diversity.

These analyses revealed that engeletin (10, 20, or 40 mg/kg) was able to reduce the infarct volume, increase cerebral blood flow, improve neurological function, and bolster the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), vasohibin-2 (Vash-2), angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), phosphorylated human angiopoietin receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (p-Tie2), and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1/CD31) in MCAO rats. Similarly, engeletin (100, 200, or 400 nM) markedly enhanced the migration, tube formation, and VEGF expression of HUVECs in an OGD/R model system, while the VEGF receptor (R) inhibitor axitinib reversed the observed changes in HUVEC tube formation activity and Vash-2, VEGF, and CD31 expression. These data suggested that engeletin exhibited significant neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury in rats, and improved cerebrovascular angiogenesis by modulating the VEGF/vasohibin and Ang-1/Tie-2 pathways.',\n",
              " 'The etiology of subacute combined degeneration (SCD) of the spinal cord is closely associated with vitamin B12 (VitB12) deficiency. The clinical manifestations of SCD are complex and vary substantially. Due to some SCD patients with atypical manifestations and concomitant autoimmune disorders, the probability of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis is still relatively high in the early stage. We report the cases of two patients who were missed or misdiagnosed at another hospital because of the normal initial VitB12 level and partial overlap of clinical manifestations, finally diagnosed as SCD with atypical manifestations and concomitant autoimmune disorders, pharyngeal-cervical-brachial Guillain-Barre syndrome in Case 1 and SCD with autoimmune thyroiditis in Case 2. After undergoing corresponding treatment, death was reported in Case 1 and improvement in Case 2. Analysis of the clinical manifestations and investigation of the underlying pathogenesis in such patients could help improve the rate of early diagnosis and allow timely treatment of SCD, thereby preventing disease progression and poor clinical outcomes.',\n",
              " 'This study aimed to estimate household pesticide exposure in adult individuals in the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and to verify the accessibility of these products in local and online businesses. The data were collected by an online questionnaire (1,015 responses) and a shelf survey in physical and online stores. Among the responses analyzed, 87.5% used pesticides in the previous year, most of which against mosquitoes (64.7%). The most common application method was aerosol spray (38.1%), and the most frequent places of use were bedrooms (29.7%) and living rooms (22.1%). About 30% of respondents reported invasion of pests, and the most common pests were ants (79.1%) and cockroaches (40.4%). Service area (71.6%) and kitchen (17.5%) were the most common storage locations. Approximately 91% of those who lived with children aged under 18 used pesticides. The use of chemical group of pyrethroids prevailed (81.6%), and 90.8% of the reportedly used products are class II [55.7% (highly toxic)] or class III [35.1% (medium toxic)]. The most significant amount of purchased products was in the pest category, followed by mosquitoes. More variety of products were available in online stores than in physical stores. The high exposure of the population to pesticides at household is a public health issue and confirms the need for studies that better assess the risks and consequences of chronic and low-dose exposure to these substances. It is essential to inform the population about the uncertainties and potential risks of indiscriminate use so that they can choose whether to use pesticides in their households.',\n",

Each defect was treated differently, using autograft (ABG), ABG associated with PC (ABG + PC), ABG with PPP (ABG + PPP), isolated PPP, and blood clot (control). The animals were submitted to euthanasia on the second, fourth and sixth week post-surgery.,The defects that received ABG+PC or PPP demonstrated lower bone formation when compared to specimens that received ABG in the same period. These results coincided to significant higher immunopositivity for TGF-ß1 for specimens that received PC, and lower presence of cytokine in the group PPP. However, either higher or lower presence of TGF-ß1 were also correlated to lower presence of osteocalcin. Likewise, these results were similar to findings in specimens treated only with PPP when compared to control.,PC and PPP were not effective when applied in association with ABG. Similarly, isolated use of PPP was not beneficial in optimizing the bone repair.',\n",

The critical bone defect was induced in the medial region of the skull calotte with the aid of an 8-mm-diameter trephine drill. The biomaterial was implanted in the form of 1.5 mm thick scaffolds, and samples were collected after 15, 30 and 60 days. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used, with the significance level of 5% (p = 0.05).,Histology revealed morphological and structural differences of the neoformed tissue between the experimental groups. Collagen-1 (Col-1) findings are consistent with the histological ones, in which BG2 presented the highest amount of fibers in its tissue matrix in all evaluated periods. In contrast, the results of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-? ligand (Rank-L) immunoexpression were higher in BG2 in the periods of 30 and 60 days, indicating an increase of the degradation of the biomaterial and the remodeling activity of the bone.,The properties of the HA/PLGA/Bleed scaffold were superior when compared to the scaffold composed only by HA/PLGA.',\n",

              " 'Maintaining the coexistence of algae and corals depends on the interactions between them. We investigated these interactions to assess: (1) recruitment patterns of algal turfs over time in dead areas on live corals; (2) the influence of fine-scale differences in coral-dominated environments on algal colonisation; (3) the influence of coral as a substrate for algal recruitment; (4) the invasion potential of algal turf on live coral tissue. This study compared algal colonisation directly on dead or damaged coral areas with algal colonisation on recruitment plates in coral-dominated or -free areas at 23, 154, and 230 days. We also monitored coral colonies over 1.5 years. Filamentous and articulated coralline algae were primarily evident in the early colonisation, reaching stability after 154 days. On a fine scale, the coral-dominated environment showed an increase in number of algal species and coverage. However, coral substrate was selective, with fewer species recruited to this substrate compared to the artificial plates. Furthermore, the competitive dynamics between corals and algal turfs did not result in a winner over time. Thus, algal turf colonisation was influenced not only by coral substrate but also by the reef environment on a fine scale.',\n",

The objective of this study was to use fuzzy classification to determine the degree of membership (fuzzy index - FI) of macronutrientes and leaf micronutrients classified as low, adequate and high, quantify the chlorophyll index and to determine the spatial variability of these attributes for the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) (Fx 3864) at the initial stage of development, aiming at the definition of management zones. Sampling grid regulates at 6x7 m spacing was built to determine the attributes: chlorophyll a and b, macro and leaf micronutrients, totaling 100 sample points. The fuzzy classification and geostatistical was used to map the nutritional status of the rubber tree. In the fuzzy analysis the macronutrient map shows the degree of membership 0.50<FI<0.75, in more than 75% of the area, indicating high nutritional status. The limiting factor was the concentration of P in the lowest percentage of points (58%) in the appropriate class. Micronutrients have 0.25<FI<0.50, for more than 75% of the area, therefore, average nutritional status. Leaf Cu presented 48% of the data in low sufficiency. Therefore, it is recommended to analyze macronutrients and leaf micronutrients separately to define management zones for foliar fertilization. Chlorophyll a, b and a/b leaf index do not correlate with macronutrients and fuzzyficated micronutrients. The leaf indices of chlorophyll a and b have a very high correlation (r = 0.89).',\n",

The objective of the present study was to review the dental formulae of Brazilian Canidae, Felidae, Mephitidae, Mustelidae and Procyonidae. We illustrate the dental morphology of all Brazilian genera, and report intra and interspecific tooth variation, and supernumerary teeth. We examined skulls and mandibles of 710 Brazilian terrestrial carnivores, including juvenile and adult specimens. Adults of all genera have three incisors and one canine in each quadrant. Members of the canid family have the following postcanine formula P 4/4 and M 2/3, except Speothos venaticus (M 1/2); felids have P 3/2 and M 1/1; mephitids present P 2/3 and M 1/2; mustelids show P 2-4/2-3 and M 1/2; and finally, procyonids have P 4/4 and M 2/2, except Potos flavus (P 3/3). Supernumerary teeth were found in individuals of seven genera in every family except Procyonidae. Although our results corroborate previous descriptions based on vouchered material, we detected several incongruences being replicated, possibly due to the lack of examination of museum vouchers, propagating erroneous information without critical analysis.

Synthesized compounds characterized with elemental analysis, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry. 1H-13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Antimutagenic activity was evaluated by micronuclei assay. Antimicrobial activity of Schiff bases have been demonstrated against pathogenic four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus cereus) and four Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudumonas aeroginosa, Salmonella typhi H, Brucella abortus, Escherichia coli) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The results showed that both Schiff bases have antimutagenic activity. Especially, high concentration (20 µM) of (E)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-6-(2-((p-tolylimino)methyl)phenoxy)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3,4,5-triol (Compound I) and (E)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-6-(2-((o-tolylimino)methyl)phenoxy)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3,4,5-triol (Compound II) have strong antimutagenic activity against aflatoxin B1. On the other hand, both of studied compounds were found effective against pathogenic bacteria and yeasts. Compound I exhibited more activity against P. aeroginosa, S aureus, S.typhi H and C. albicans comparable to Compound II and standard antibiotics. Additionally, Compound II showed better inhibitory activity than Compound I against Candida albicans and Br. Abortus. Therefore, these compounds can be used in phytotherapeutic due to theirs antimutagenic and antimicrobial activities.',\n",

Currently, to mitigate these risks, studies are searching for plants with potential for the control of agricultural pests, also known as botanical insecticides. In this study, the fumigant toxicity of the essential oils of Piper callosum (PC-EO), Piper marginatum (PM-EO) and Vitex agnus-castus (VA-EO) against Zabrotes subfasciatus was investigated. The essential oils of PC-EO, PM-EO and VA-EO were analysed by gas chromatography (GC-MS), and the major components were 3,4-methylenedioxypropiophenone (10.4%), bicyclogermacrene (10.1%) and germacrene D (9.9%) for PM-EO; safrol (29.3%) for PC-EO; and 1,8-cineol (23.8%) for VA-EO. In fumigation tests, VA-EO killed 100% Zabrotes subfasciatus at a concentration of 0.004 µL/L air after 24 h of treatment, whereas PC-EO and PM-EO at 0.01 µL/L air caused 100% Z. subfasciatus mortality after 48 h. The VA-EO sample provided the lowest LD50 after 24 h (0.17 µL/L air), followed by PC-EO (0.78 µL/L air) and PM-EO (1.17 µL/L air). These results demonstrate that the essential oils of these species can be an alternative to control pests in stored products. This is the first report of the fumigant potential of these species against Z. subfasciatus.',\n",
              " 'Modal classifications of common volcanic rocks are expensive, difficult, or impossible to attain. As a consequence, these rocks are classified using the chemical composition. However, existing classificatory diagrams are unable to identify all 16 families of common volcanic rocks; the most used is the total alkali-silica (TAS) diagram that identifies six families. Rocks not in the TAS diagram are misclassified with other rock names; their names are evolving to extinction, e.g. latite and rhyodacite. Some diagrams use Na2O, which is a complicating element rather than discriminant. Na2O is present both in alkali feldspar and plagioclase making difficult the separation of the amount associated to either feldspar. Silicon, potassium, and calcium are the three major elements with highest variations among volcanic rocks. They are selected for use in two new diagrams confronting CaO/K2O ratio with K2O content (KCK diagrams). One diagram is designed for saturated (intermediate) rocks (quartz <5 vol.%) and the other for oversaturated (acid) volcanic rocks (quartz >5%). These diagrams are tested using compositions of volcanic rocks from Uatumã magmatism in the Amazon Craton and also by plotting compositions of rocks from type-localities and the world averages. The proposed limits between rock families agree with plotted rock compositions. The KCK diagrams are an alternative to existing diagrams to classify volcanic rocks.',\n",

We (i) compared microcrustacean composition in eutrophic and oligotrophic habitats under net tank influence, (ii) investigated changes in species distributions in these habitats, and (iii) indicated which chlorophyll-a concentrations presented thresholds that alter community structure. We expected different responses of species to changes in chlorophyll-a concentration due to net cage management, as chlorophyll-a represents an estimate of food availability. Microcrustacean samplings and chlorophyll-a estimation were made upstream, downstream and close to the net cages, during 120 days, in the Rosana Reservoir (Brazil). Species composition differed significantly (p<0.05) among habitats where in the eutrophic environment was found the largest number of species. However, only in the eutrophic habitats did frequency of occurrence and relative abundance of some species change with chlorophyll-a variation. Thus, net cage management influenced species distribution only in the most productive habitat. These responses can affect ecosystem processes related to trophic dynamics as secondary productivity and nutrient cycling.',\n",

A retrospective, ecological study was carried out, comprising 5,564 Brazilian municipalities. The number of dental procedures (per 100,000 inhabitants) performed in the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS) was the outcome. The impact of the pandemic was estimated by comparing the rate of procedures for each month of 2020 with the rates observed in the equivalent months in 2019, considering the period from March to August. Regulatory legislation regarding restrictions on dental care, issued by the state governments of 27 Brazilian federative units, was used for mediation analysis. A 55% reduction was observed in March for all procedures (IRR = 0.45, 95%CI 0.39-0.51), while in the other months, the rate of reduction remained = 88%. The biggest decrease was observed in collective preventive procedures (reduction =99%) between April and August. Procedures that were less likely to generate aerosols (tooth extraction and prosthetic) and emergencies showed the smallest reduction. The reduction was not mediated by the restrictions imposed by state governments (p>0.05). The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was noteworthy in terms of the decrease in the number of dental procedures carried out in the Brazilian Public Dental Service.

The association between gBRCA1/BRCA2 and somatic mutations in PIK3CA was investigated.,The overall frequency of gBRCA1/BRCA2 among the 49 postmenopausal patients was 10.2%. The frequencies of somatic mutations in PIK3CA in the postmenopausal and young patients were 37% and 17%, respectively (ns). The most common PIK3CA mutation was found to be E454A. Nonsense and frameshift mutations, which may counteract the oncogenic potential of PIK3CA were also detected. Regardless of age, 25% of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers and non-carriers , each, had PIK3CA somatic mutations.,Data obtained indicate that BRCA1/BRCA2 gene testing may be considered for postmenopausal patients with BC who have a family history of cancer. Although some of them are not considered pathogenic, somatic variants of PIK3CA are frequently observed in BC patients, especially in postmenopausal patients.',\n",
              " 'To investigate whether quantitative textural features, extracted from pretreatment MRI, can predict sustained complete response to radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).,In this IRB-approved study, patients were selected from a maintained six-year database of consecutive patients who underwent both pretreatment MRI imaging with a probable or definitive imaging diagnosis of HCC (LI-RADS 4 or 5) and loco-regional treatment with RFA. An experienced radiologist manually segmented the hepatic nodules in MRI arterial and equilibrium phases to obtain the volume of interest (VOI) for extraction of 107 quantitative textural features, including shape and first- and second-order features. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate associations between textural features and complete response.,The study consisted of 34 patients with 51 treated hepatic nodules. Sustained complete response was achieved by 6 patients (4 with single nodule and 2 with multiple nodules). Of the 107 features from the arterial and equilibrium phases, 20 (18%) and 25 (23%) achieved AUC >0.7, respectively. The three best performing features were found in the equilibrium phase: Dependence Non-Uniformity Normalized and Dependence Variance (both GLDM class, with AUC of 0.78 and 0.76, respectively) and Maximum Probability (GLCM class, AUC of 0.76).,This pilot study demonstrates that a radiomic analysis of pre-treatment MRI might be useful in identifying patients with HCC who are most likely to have a sustained complete response to RFA. Second-order features (GLDM and GLCM) extracted from equilibrium phase obtained highest discriminatory performance.',\n",

In this study, we analyzed endovascular treatment of isolated descending thoracic aortic disease cases in the Brazilian public health system over a 12-year period.,Public data from procedures performed from 2008 to 2019 were extracted using web scraping techniques to assess procedure type frequency (elective or urgency), mortality, and governmental costs.,A total of 5,595 procedures were analyzed, the vast majority of which were urgent procedures (61.82% vs. 38.18%). In-hospital mortality was lower for elective than for urgent surgeries (4.96 vs.10.32% p=0.008). An average of R$16,845.86 and R$20,012.04 was paid per elective and emergency procedure, respectively, with no statistical difference (p=0.095).,Elective procedures were associated with lower mortality than urgent procedures. There was no statistically significant difference between elective and urgent procedures regarding costs.',\n",

The samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 on rRT-PCR with the primers and probes described in the CDC protocol which amplify the region of the nucleocapsid N gene (2019_nCoV_N1 and 2019_nCoV_N2) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and compared with naso/oropharyngeal swabs collected within 24 hours of the conjunctival swabs.,Five conjunctival samples (10%) tested positive (amplification of the N1 and N2 primer/probe sets) while two conjunctival samples (4%) yielded inconclusive results (amplification of the N1 primer/probe set only). The naso/oropharyngeal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on rRT-PCR in 34 patients (68%), negative in 14 (28%) and inconclusive in 2 (4%). The 5 patients with positive conjunctival swabs had positive (n=2), negative (n=2) or inconclusive (n=1) naso/oropharyngeal swabs on rRT-PCR. Patients with negative or inconclusive naso/oropharyngeal swabs had the diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by previous positive rRT-PCR results or by serology.,This is the first study to present conjunctival swab rRT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 in a Brazilian population.

The search for new therapeutic strategies (i.e., antimicrobial peptides-AMPs) has thus become a pressing need.,Characterising and evaluating Sarconesiopsis magellanica larval fat body-derived AMPs.,Fat body extracts were analysed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC); mass spectrometry was used for characterising the primary structure of the AMPs so found. ProtParam (Expasy) was used for analysing the AMPs' physico-chemical properties. Synthetic AMPs' antibacterial activity was evaluated.,Four new AMPs were obtained and called sarconesin III, IV, V and VI. Sarconesin III had an a-helix structure and sarconesins IV, V and VI had linear formations. Oligomer prediction highlighted peptide-peptide interactions, suggesting that sarconesins III, V and VI could form self-aggregations when in contact with the microbial membrane. AMPs synthesised from their native molecules' sequences had potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria and, to a lesser extent, against Gram-negative and drug-resistant bacteria. Sarconesin VI was the most efficient AMP. None of the four synthetic AMPs had a cytotoxic effect.,S. magellanica larval fat body-derived antimicrobial peptides are an important source of AMPs and could be used in different antimicrobial therapies and overcoming bacterial resistance.\",\n",
              " 'Endophytic bacteria serve key roles in the maintenance of plant health and growth. Few studies to date, however, have explored the antagonistic and plant growth-promoting (PGP) properties of Prunus cerasifera endophytes. To that end, we isolated endophytic bacteria from P. cerasifera tissue samples and used a dual culture plate assay to screen these microbes for antagonistic activity against Verticillium dahliae, Botryosphaeria dothidea, Fusarium oxysporum, F. graminearum, and F. moniliforme. Of the 36 strains of isolated bacteria, four (strains P1, P10, P16, and P20) exhibited antagonistic effects against all five model pathogens, and the P10 strain exhibited the strongest antagonistic to five pathogens. This P10 strain was then characterized in-depth via phenotypic assessments, physiological analyses, and 16s rDNA sequencing, revealing it to be a strain of Bacillus subtilis. Application of a P10 cell suspension (1×108 CFU/mL) significantly enhanced the seed germination and seedling growth of tomato in a greenhouse setting. This P10 strain further significantly suppressed tomato Verticillium wilt with much lower disease incidence and disease index scores being observed following P10 treatment relative to untreated plants in pot-based experiments. Tomato plants that had been treated with strain P10 also enhanced defense-related enzymes, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activity upon V. dahliae challenge relative to plants that had not been treated with this endophytic bacterium. The results revealed that the P10 bacterial strain has potential value as a biocontrol agent for use in the prevention of tomato Verticillium wilt.',\n",

In England, the NHS (National Health Service) Long Term Plan promised the right to access digital-first primary care by March 31, 2024. However, there are few global, fully digital-first providers and limited research into their effects on cost from a health system perspective.,The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of highly accessible, digital-first primary care on acute hospital spending.,A retrospective, observational analysis compared acute hospital spending on patients registered to a 24/7, digital-first model of NHS primary care with that on patients registered to all other practices in North West London Collaboration of Clinical Commissioning Groups. Acute hospital spending data per practice were obtained under a freedom of information request. Three versions of NHS techniques designed to fairly allocate funding according to need were used to standardize or weight the practice populations; hence, there are 3 results for each year. The weighting adjusted the populations for characteristics that impact health care spending, such as age, sex, and deprivation. The total spending was divided by the number of standardized or weighted patients to give the spending per weighted patient, which was used to compare the 2 groups in the NHS financial years (FY) 2018-2019 (FY18/19) and 2019-2020 (FY19/20). FY18/19 costs were adjusted for inflation, so they were comparable with the values of FY19/20.,The NHS spending on acute hospital care for 2.43 million and 2.54 million people (FY18/19 and FY19/20) across 358 practices and 49 primary care networks was £1.6 billion and £1.65 billion (a currency exchange rate of £1=US $1.38 is applicable), respectively. The spending on acute care per weighted patient for Babylon GP at Hand members was 12%, 31%, and 54% (£93, P=.047; £223, P<.001; and £389, P<.001) lower than the regional average in FY18/19 for the 3 weighting methodologies used. In FY19/20, it was 15%, 35%, and 51% (£114, P=.006; £246, P<.001; and £362, P<.001) lower. This amounted to lower costs for the Babylon GP at Hand population of £1.37, £4.40 million, and £11.6 million, respectively, in FY18/19; and £3.26 million, £9.54 million, and £18.8 million, respectively, in FY19/20.,Patients with access to 24/7, digital-first primary care incurred significantly lower acute hospital costs.',\n",

The scarcity and uneven distribution of specialized mental health teams in Chile may limit the provision and quality of care for this vulnerable population. Telepsychiatry can address such health inequities.,The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a telepsychiatry consultation program for primary health care (PHC) treatment of children and adolescents living under the supervision of child protective services.,We developed a telepsychiatry consultation program for two rural PHC clinics located in central Chile (Valparaíso Region) and evaluated its implementation using a mixed methods study design. The program consisted of videoconferencing mental health consultation sessions scheduled twice per month (each 90 minutes long), over a 6-month period, delivered by child and adolescent psychiatrists based in Santiago, Chile. We described the number of mental health consultation sessions, participant characteristics, perceived usefulness and acceptability, and experiences with the telepsychiatry consultation program.,During the 6-month study period, 15 videoconferencing mental health consultation sessions were held. The telepsychiatry consultation program assisted PHC clinicians in assigning the most adequate diagnoses and making treatment decisions on pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy of 11 minors with complex care needs. The intervention was perceived to be useful by PHC clinicians for improving the resolution capacity in the treatments of this patient population. Limitations such as connectivity issues were resolved in most sessions.,The telepsychiatry consultation program was feasible and potentially useful to support PHC clinicians in the management of institutionalized children and adolescents with complex psychosocial care needs living in a poorly resourced setting. A larger scale trial should assess clinical outcomes in the patient population. Regulations and resources for this service model are needed to facilitate sustainability and large-scale implementation.',\n",

A secondary objective was to evaluate the alignment between the Keyhole symbol and the Health Star Rating.,The FoodSwitch app is a mobile health (mHealth) tool used to present nutrition data and healthier alternative products to consumers. Ready-to-eat breakfast cereals from the largest Swedish grocery retailers were collected using the FoodSwitch platform. Products were defined as targeting children if they presented features addressing children on the package.,Overall, information on 261 ready-to-eat cereals was examined. Of this total, 8% (n=21) were targeted at children. Child-targeted cereals were higher in sugar (22.3 g/100 g vs 12.8 g/100 g, P<.001) and lower in fiber (6.2 g/100 g vs 9.8 g/100 g, P<.001) and protein (8.1 g/100 g vs 10.5 g/100 g, P<.001).

Diabetes complications can be prevented through better disease control, but there is a large gap between the recommended treatment and the treatment that patients actually receive. The treatment of T2DM can be challenging because of different comprehensive therapeutic targets and individual variability of the patients, leading to the need for precise, personalized treatment.,The aim of this study was to develop treatment recommendation models for T2DM based on deep reinforcement learning. A retrospective analysis was then performed to evaluate the reliability and effectiveness of the models.,The data used in our study were collected from the Singapore Health Services Diabetes Registry, encompassing 189,520 patients with T2DM, including 6,407,958 outpatient visits from 2013 to 2018. The treatment recommendation model was built based on 80% of the dataset and its effectiveness was evaluated with the remaining 20% of data. Three treatment recommendation models were developed for antiglycemic, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering treatments by combining a knowledge-driven model and a data-driven model. The knowledge-driven model, based on clinical guidelines and expert experiences, was first applied to select the candidate medications. The data-driven model, based on deep reinforcement learning, was used to rank the candidates according to the expected clinical outcomes. To evaluate the models, short-term outcomes were compared between the model-concordant treatments and the model-nonconcordant treatments with confounder adjustment by stratification, propensity score weighting, and multivariate regression. For long-term outcomes, model-concordant rates were included as independent variables to evaluate if the combined antiglycemic, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering treatments had a positive impact on reduction of long-term complication occurrence or death at the patient level via multivariate logistic regression.,The test data consisted of 36,993 patients for evaluating the effectiveness of the three treatment recommendation models. In 43.3% of patient visits, the antiglycemic medications recommended by the model were concordant with the actual prescriptions of the physicians. The concordant rates for antihypertensive medications and lipid-lowering medications were 51.3% and 58.9%, respectively. The evaluation results also showed that model-concordant treatments were associated with better glycemic control (odds ratio [OR] 1.73, 95% CI 1.69-1.76), blood pressure control (OR 1.26, 95% CI, 1.23-1.29), and blood lipids control (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.22-1.35). We also found that patients with more model-concordant treatments were associated with a lower risk of diabetes complications (including 3 macrovascular and 2 microvascular complications) and death, suggesting that the models have the potential of achieving better outcomes in the long term.,Comprehensive management by combining knowledge-driven and data-driven models has good potential to help physicians improve the clinical outcomes of patients with T2DM; achieving good control on blood glucose, blood pressure, and blood lipids; and reducing the risk of diabetes complications in the long term.',\n",

The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to 12 months in rachitic lesions on knee MRI. Secondary endpoints were changes in biochemical parameters of phosphate and alkaline phosphatase (ALP).,One year of treatment with burosumab significantly reduced radiological disease activity on knee MRI (by 44 ± 29% in the transverse extent of widening) which was accompanied by a significant reduction in biochemical activity, namely in serum ALP activity, by 28 ± 17%. Additionally, MRI parameters after 1 year of treatment with burosumab (the maximum width of medial physis at 12 months and the change from baseline in the maximum width of lateral physis) were associated with ALP activity at 12 months.,We suggest that MRI is a valuable and quantitative tool to evaluate the therapeutic response to burosumab. MRI could be an excellent alternative to standard bone radiographs for evaluation of the rachitic lesions in a clinical setting avoiding repeated exposition to ionizing radiation.',\n",

This cross-sectional study describes the prevalence of elevated body mass index (BMI) (=85th percentile) and obesity (=95th percentile) in youth aged 9 to 19 years receiving care in CHCs in 2014. Multilevel logistic regression estimated the prevalence of elevated BMI and obesity by age, race/ethnicity, and sex. Among 64 925 youth, 40% had elevated BMI and 22% were obese. By race, obesity was lowest in the combined Asian/Pacific Islander category (13%); however, when subgroups were separated, the highest prevalence was among Native Hawaiians (33%) and Other Pacific Islanders (42%) and the lowest in Asians. By sex, Black females and Hispanic and Asian males were more likely to be obese. By age, the highest prevalence of obesity was among those aged 9 to 10 years (25%). Youth served by CHCs have a high prevalence of obesity, with significant differences observed by race, sex, and age. Combining race categories obscures disparities. The heterogeneity of communities warrants research that describes different populations to address obesity.',\n",

Trials investigating changes in HbA1c were selected. Screening was performed independently by two investigators. Two investigators extracted HbA1c at baseline and follow-up for each trial.,Nineteen trials involving 4,965 participants were included. Overall, self-monitoring of blood glucose reduced HbA1c. Preplanned subgroup analysis showed that using self-monitoring of blood glucose readings to adjust therapy contributed significantly to the reduction. No significant improvement in HbA1c was shown in self-monitoring of blood glucose without therapy adjustment. The same difference was observed in structured versus unstructured self-monitoring of blood glucose.,HbA1c is improved with clinician therapy modification based on structured self-monitoring of blood glucose readings. Implications are for clinicians to prescribe structured self-monitoring of blood glucose to modify therapy based on the readings and not prescribe unstructured self-monitoring of blood glucose. Participants with suboptimal glycemic control may benefit most. A self-monitoring of blood glucose regimen that improves clinical and cost-effectiveness is presented. Future studies can investigate this regimen specifically.',\n",
              " 'Sex estimation is one of the big three of human identification and is a vital aspect of the process of generating biological profile of unknown deceased. Anthropometric and odontometric methods that utilize measurement of distances between certain landmarks are commonly employed to differentiate between the 2 sexes. Teeth are the most robust and well-preserved parts of the human body, and studies have shown that the sex of an unknown individual can be estimated using their measurements. The present study was carried out to analyze the sex differences based on the dental arch dimensions of both the jaws in an Indian population. A proper understanding of dental arch dimensions not only help forensic odontologists in human identification, but also help dental practitioners in teeth restoration, and to quantify selection of anterior teeth in bonding of dentures. The dental arch dimensions of the canines, premolars, and the molars of both the jaws were recorded in dental casts of 307 participants. Comparison of the dental arch dimensions of males and females was done and logistic regression models were generated to estimate sex. Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis was done to find out the potential to estimate sex for all the dental arch dimensions in both the sexes. It was observed that maxillary intermolar II distance gave the best results in estimating the sex. The sexing accuracy is seen to increase as we go distally from canines to molars in each jaw; minimum for intercanine distance and maximum for distance between the 2nd molars. The sexing accuracy from dental arch dimensions was found to be between 72.7% and 86.5%. The models derived for estimation of sex from dental arch dimensions can be used in cases of skeletal remains.',\n",

This study provides background on the ready-made three-dimensional printed PCL implant for nasal lobule correction, before discussing the usefulness and effectiveness of the implant. A total of 23 patients who visited our hospital between January 2018 and January 2020 were evaluated in this study. We used 3 types of PCL implant to get an ideal shape for the nasal tip: tipball (globular shape), droneball (rugby ball shape), and dumbbell (dumbbell shape). The authors compared nasolabial angle and tip projection at the preoperative and postoperative period via photographic anthropometric analysis. In 4 patients, we also examined the dead space between the implant and soft tissue via ultrasonography. The follow-up period averaged 9.5 months and no serious complications were found after surgery. The nasolabial angle and tip projection had an average postoperative increase of 6.4° and 0.044, respectively. Ultrasonography revealed the attachment of the implant at the insertion site and no dead space was found. This is the first attempt to apply a ready-made three-dimensional printed PCL implant to a nasal lobule correction procedure. As the implant was easy to use and showed good results, it may be useful for aesthetic purposes in future nasal tip plasty procedures.',\n",

              " 'Randomized cross-over study.,The aim of this study was to compare exercise, the criterion standard, to the postural garment PosturePlusForce in the management of nonspecific cervical pain in women. We also analyzed both interventions with regards to baseline posture, use of pharmacological pain relievers, compliance, and comfort.,The prevalence of neck pain has increased during the last decade, preferentially affecting women. Those suffering from this condition may manifest a decrease in quality of life and inability to work. Consistent recommendations highlight the importance of exercise and posture for neck pain improvement.,A total of 32 female health care professionals with cervical pain (=3 on the visual analogue scale) entered the trial. Participants were allocated to either performing exercises or wearing the postural garment. The cross-over between interventions was separated by a 3-month washout period. Primary outcomes included pain intensity and posture. Secondary outcomes comprised cervical pain-related disability, psychological factors, physical activity, global perceived effect of treatment, and garment comfort. Treatment compliance, medication use, and adverse events were also recorded.,Both interventions showed a significant improvement in pain in subjects with an adherence >60%. However, in participants with dorsal hyperkyphosis (>45°), the garment demonstrated a greater reduction in pain than exercise (P = 0.019). Additionally, those wearing the garment needed fewer pain relievers than those performing exercises (P = 0.007). Compliance was >50% for both interventions and comfort was contingent on season.,In our study, PosturePlusForce showed, at least, a similar effect on pain to exercise, although those with dorsal hyperkyphosis exhibited a greater reduction in pain and related variables with the garment. Pain relievers were less required by those wearing PosturePlusForce than by those performing the exercises.Level of Evidence: 1.',\n",
              " 'Primates exhibit unusual quadrupedal features (e.g. diagonal gaits, compliant walk) compared with other quadrupedal mammals. Their origin and diversification in arboreal habitats have certainly shaped the mechanics of their walking pattern to meet the functional requirements necessary for balance control in unstable and discontinuous environments. In turn, the requirements for mechanical stability probably conflict with mechanical energy exchange. In order to investigate these aspects, we conducted an integrative study on quadrupedal walking in the olive baboon (Papio anubis) at the Primatology station of the CNRS in France. Based on kinematics, we describe the centre of mass mechanics of the normal quadrupedal gait performed on the ground, as well as in different gait and substrate contexts. In addition, we studied the muscular activity of six hindlimb muscles using non-invasive surface probes. Our results show that baboons can rely on an inverted pendulum-like exchange of energy (57% on average, with a maximal observed value of 84%) when walking slowly (<0.9 m s-1) with a tight limb phase (~55%) on the ground using diagonal sequence gaits. In this context, the muscular activity is similar to that of other quadrupedal mammals, thus reflecting the primary functions of the muscles for limb movement and support. In contrast, walking on a suspended branch generates kinematic and muscular adjustments to ensure better control and to maintain stability. Finally, walking using the lateral sequence gait increases muscular effort and reduces the potential for high recovery rates. The present exploratory study thus supports the assumption that primates are able to make use of an inverted pendulum mechanism on the ground using a diagonal walking gait, yet a different footfall pattern and substrate appear to influence muscular effort and efficiency.',\n",
              " 'Most cancers become more dangerous by the outgrowth of malignant subclones with additional DNA mutations that favor proliferation or survival. Using chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a disease that exemplifies this process and is a model for neoplasms in general, we created transgenic mice overexpressing the enzyme activation-induced deaminase (AID), which has a normal function of inducing DNA mutations in B lymphocytes. AID not only allows normal B lymphocytes to develop more effective immunoglobulin-mediated immunity, but is also able to mutate nonimmunoglobulin genes, predisposing to cancer. In CLL, AID expression correlates with poor prognosis, suggesting a role for this enzyme in disease progression. Nevertheless, direct experimental evidence identifying the specific genes that are mutated by AID and indicating that those genes are associated with disease progression is not available. To address this point, we overexpressed Aicda in a murine model of CLL (Eµ-TCL1). Analyses of TCL1/AID mice demonstrate a role for AID in disease kinetics, CLL cell proliferation, and the development of cancer-related target mutations with canonical AID signatures in nonimmunoglobulin genes. Notably, our mouse models can accumulate mutations in the same genes that are mutated in human cancers. Moreover, some of these mutations occur at homologous positions, leading to identical or chemically similar amino acid substitutions as in human CLL and lymphoma. Together, these findings support a direct link between aberrant AID activity and CLL driver mutations that are then selected for their oncogenic effects, whereby AID promotes aggressiveness in CLL and other B-cell neoplasms.',\n",
              " 'Venetoclax, a Bcl-2 inhibitor, in combination with the hypomethylating agent azacytidine, achieves complete remission with or without count recovery in ~70% of treatment-naive elderly patients unfit for conventional intensive chemotherapy. However, the mechanism of action of this drug combination is not fully understood. We discovered that venetoclax directly activated T cells to increase their cytotoxicity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in vitro and in vivo. Venetoclax enhanced T-cell effector function by increasing reactive oxygen species generation through inhibition of respiratory chain supercomplexes formation. In addition, azacytidine induced a viral mimicry response in AML cells by activating the STING/cGAS pathway, thereby rendering the AML cells more susceptible to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Similar findings were seen in patients treated with venetoclax, as this treatment increased reactive oxygen species generation and activated T cells. Collectively, this study presents a new immune-mediated mechanism of action for venetoclax and azacytidine in the treatment of AML and highlights a potential combination of venetoclax and adoptive cell therapy for patients with AML.',\n",
              " 'Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is a unique subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) with distinct clinicopathologic features and poor prognosis. We performed a subset analysis of 282 patients with AITL enrolled between 2006 and 2018 in the international prospective T-cell Project (NCT01142674). The primary and secondary end points were 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), respectively. We analyzed the prognostic impact of clinical covariates and progression of disease within 24 months (POD24) and developed a novel prognostic score. The median age was 64 years, and 90% of patients had advanced-stage disease. Eighty-one percent received anthracycline-based regimens, and 13% underwent consolidative autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in first complete remission (CR1). Five-year OS and PFS estimates were 44% and 32%, respectively, with improved outcomes for patients who underwent ASCT in CR1. In multivariate analysis, age =60 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >2, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated ß2 microglobulin were associated with inferior outcomes. A novel prognostic score (AITL score) combining these factors defined low-, intermediate-, and high-risk subgroups with 5-year OS estimates of 63%, 54%, and 21%, respectively, with greater discriminant power than established prognostic indices. Finally, POD24 was a powerful prognostic factor with 5-year OS of 63% for patients without POD24 compared with only 6% for patients with POD24 (P < .0001). These data will require validation in a prospective cohort of homogeneously treated patients. Optimal treatment of AITL continues to be an unmet need, and novel therapeutic approaches are required.',\n",
              " 'Posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis has enabled haploidentical (Haplo) transplantation to be performed with results similar to those after matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation with traditional prophylaxis. The relative value of transplantation with MUD vs Haplo donors when both groups receive PTCy/calcineurin inhibitor/mycophenolate GVHD prophylaxis is not known. We compared outcomes after 2036 Haplo and 284 MUD transplantations with PTCy GVHD prophylaxis for acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome in adults from 2011 through 2018. Cox regression models were built to compare outcomes between donor types. Recipients of myeloablative and reduced-intensity regimens were analyzed separately. Among recipients of reduced-intensity regimens, 2-year graft failure (3% vs 11%), acute grades 2 to 4 GVHD (hazards ratio [HR], 0.70; P = .022), acute grades 3 and 4 GVHD (HR, 0.41; P = .016), and nonrelapse mortality (HR, 0.43; P = .0008) were lower after MUD than with Haplo donor transplantation. Consequently, disease-free (HR, 0.74; P = .008; 55% vs 41%) and overall (HR, 0.65; P = .001; 67% vs 54%) survival were higher with MUD than with Haplo transplants. Among recipients of myeloablative regimens, day-100 platelet recovery (95% vs 88%) was higher and grades 3 and 4 acute (HR, 0.39; P = .07) and chronic GVHD (HR, 0.66; P = .05) were lower after MUD than with Haplo donor transplantation. There were no differences in graft failure, relapse, nonrelapse mortality, and disease-free and overall survival between donor types with myeloablative conditioning regimens. These data extend and confirm the importance of donor-recipient HLA matching for allogeneic transplantation. A MUD is the preferred donor, especially for transplantations with reduced-intensity conditioning regimens.',\n",
              " 'The Chd8 gene encodes a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family of SNF2H-like adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent chromatin remodeler, the mutations of which define a subtype of autism spectrum disorders. Increasing evidence from recent studies indicates that ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling genes are involved in the control of crucial gene-expression programs in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) regulation. In this study, we identified CHD8 as a specific and essential regulator of normal hematopoiesis. Loss of Chd8 leads to severe anemia, pancytopenia, bone marrow failure, and engraftment failure related to a drastic depletion of HSPCs. CHD8 forms a complex with ATM and its deficiency increases chromatin accessibility and drives genomic instability in HSPCs causing an activation of ATM kinase that further stabilizes P53 protein by phosphorylation and leads to increased HSPC apoptosis. Deletion of P53 rescues the apoptotic defects of HSPCs and restores overall hematopoiesis in Chd8-/- mice. Our findings demonstrate that chromatin organization by CHD8 is uniquely necessary for the maintenance of hematopoiesis by integrating the ATM-P53-mediated survival of HSPCs.',\n",
              " \"Accumulation patterns and gene regulatory networks of sugars and cucurbitacins and related primary and secondary metabolites during cultivated watermelon 'Cheng Lan' and wild watermelon 'PI 632,751' fruit development were identified. Metabolites are the end products of cellular regulatory processes and play important roles in fruit taste formation. However, comprehensive studies on the accumulation patterns of watermelon fruit metabolites and transcriptional regulatory networks are still scarce. In this study, 451 annotated metabolites were identified at four key fruit developmental stages in wild watermelon 'PI 632,751' and modern cultivated watermelon 'Cheng Lan'. Interestingly, 11 sugars and 25 major primary metabolites were mainly accumulated in 'Cheng Lan' during fruit development, which are considered to be the potential metabolites beneficial to the formation of watermelon taste. Cucurbitacins and the main flavonoids were mainly specifically accumulated in 'PI 632,751', not being considered to be responsible for the taste. Moreover, forty-seven genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, glycolysis, and TCA cycle were highly expressed in 'Cheng Lan', which was positively correlated with the accumulation of major primary metabolites. Alternatively, seven UDP-glycosyltransferase genes are closely related to the glycosylation of cucurbitacins through co-expression analysis. Our findings established a global map of metabolite accumulation and gene regulation during fruit development in wild and cultivated watermelons and provided valuable information on taste formation in watermelon fruit.\",\n",
              " 'Water use in coal power generation is one of the key points to highlight for the countries like India because country electricity demand increases rapidly which led to increase in water demand. The coal power sector in India will remain to be the dominant source of electricity generation until 2040 and will require a regular water supply, which is already in a stressful condition. This work focuses on the regional assessment of water withdrawal and consumption of the coal power sector at three broad stages includes fuel extraction, fuel preparation, and power generation. Our analysis reveals that 99% of the total water supply to the sector was withdrawn by power plants. Further, the study assessed its trade-off with other sectoral water demand adopting WSI (Water Stress Index) criteria for both surface and groundwater sources. The results highlighted the per capita groundwater to be under severe stress and similar status was also identified in the case of fresh surface water except for the Central region. The overall WSI status was found to be severe in all regions of India. This situation creates a water-scarce situation for water-guzzling power plants that are dependent on surface water and faces the competitive situation with the agriculture and domestic sector. Results of the study concluded that the technological up-gradation at the power plants could be helpful to reduce the total water demand by 78% of coal power sector which can be reduced the severity of regional water stress. Our study aids policymakers to identify the region which is more vulnerable in terms of cross-sectoral water demand and also fulfills the need for quality data availability at a regional scale that may use in the future towards sustainable water-resources management practices.',\n",
              " 'The study aimed to explore the serum levels of HSP70 and identify its possible association with serum cortisol, thyroid hormones, and acute-phase protein concentrations in cattle naturally infected with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus. After the FMD outbreak in an organized dairy cattle farm in India, blood samples were obtained from clinically infected (n = 40) and apparently healthy (n = 30) animals. Samples were processed and tested by an in-house DIVA assay for confirmation of FMD infection. Serum was analyzed for\\xa0HSP70, cortisol, T4, T3, haptoglobin, and serum amyloid A by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). HSP70 concentrations were significantly higher in the serum of clinically infected cattle (p < 0.01) than the healthy group. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the elevated serum levels of HSP70 under infectious diseases of bovines. Cortisol (p < 0.05), haptoglobin (p < 0.001), and serum amyloid A (p < 0.05) concentrations also markedly increased in the diseased animals; however, no differences (p > 0.05) were found in T4 and T3 levels between healthy and infected cattle. Elevated HSP70 concentration correlated positively with high cortisol (p < 0.05) and haptoglobin (p < 0.001) levels suggesting an essential link between these acute events during clinical infectious phase of FMD.',\n",
              " 'Political instability and economic crises may trigger informal, unsustainable and often illegal land use, leading to land degradation. One of the most recent and striking examples of such a phenomenon within Europe is demonstrated by the Polissia region in Northern Ukraine, famous for its amber deposits. Amid severe political disturbances and subsequent economic recession in Ukraine in 2014 and 2015, amber mining flourished in the region. However, the extent and spatial pattern of degraded land caused by amber mining over the entire region has remained unknown. To fill this gap and track land surface changes, we used multi-source satellite imagery. We found a gradual decrease of the area without vegetation cover, as a proxy for degraded land, from the late Soviet period until 2014 in most of the analysed administrative districts of Polissia. In contrast to this, we identified substantial conversion of forest and agricultural land to bare soil that occurred between 2014 and 2016, which can be attributed to the rush of illegal amber mining in the region. The estimated total area of affected land on the produced Landsat-based map for 2016 was 1066\\xa0ha, 60% of which occurred in 2014-2016. Land cover classification within a key study area suggests that utilization of very high-resolution images from the WorldView-2 satellite enables more accurate mapping of land degradation and identification of small mining sites. Further monitoring of land-use change caused by amber mining is essential to improving understanding of long-lasting environmental impacts on regional ecosystems and biodiversity.',\n",
              " 'The aim of the study was to assess the effect of feeding the same diet to different breeds of chickens and at different ages on fatty acid (FA) composition of the breast and thigh muscles. A total of 150 chickens comprising 50 each of red jungle fowl (RJ) and village chicken (VC), the slow-growing birds, and the commercial broiler (CB), fast-growing birds, were used for this study. Ten chickens from each breed were serially euthanized at days 1, 10, 20, 56, and 120 post hatch, and pectoralis major and bicep femoris were harvested to represent the breast and thigh muscles respectively. It was revealed that the breast muscle concentrations of saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are significantly different (p<0.05) among the breeds. Also, the FA composition of breast and thigh muscles among RJ, VC, and CB at various ages studied varied significantly (p<0.05) but without a definite pattern. The composition of MUFA was lower, but that of PUFA was higher in the RJ and VC than in the CB breast muscles. Within the breeds, the composition of total MUFA decreased, while that of PUFA increased with age. The total MUFA and PUFA showed no significant difference (p>0.05) between the breast and thigh muscles at different ages evaluated. This study suggests that slow-growing birds (RJ and VC) might be better sources of desirable FA than the fast-growing birds, CB.',\n",

Specifically, do neuropsychological tests commonly used to assess attention measure the same construct as attention paradigms used in cognitive psychology and neuroscience? We built on the general attention factor, comprising several widely used experimental paradigms (Huang et al., 2012). Participants (n = 636) completed an on-line battery (TestMyBrain.org) of six experimental tests [Multiple Object Tracking, Flanker Interference, Visual Working Memory, Approximate Number Sense, Spatial Configuration Visual Search, and Gradual Onset Continuous Performance Task (Grad CPT)] and eight neuropsychological tests [Trail Making Test versions A & B (TMT-A, TMT-B), Digit Symbol Coding, Forward and Backward Digit Span, Letter Cancellation, Spatial Span, and Arithmetic]. Exploratory factor analysis in a subset of 357 participants identified a five-factor structure: (1) attentional capacity (Multiple Object Tracking, Visual Working Memory, Digit Symbol Coding, Spatial Span), (2) search (Visual Search, TMT-A, TMT-B, Letter Cancellation); (3) Digit Span; (4) Arithmetic; and (5) Sustained Attention (GradCPT). Confirmatory analysis in 279 held-out participants showed that this model fit better than competing models. A hierarchical model where a general cognitive factor was imposed above the five specific factors fit as well as the model without the general factor. We conclude that Digit Span and Arithmetic tests should not be classified as attention tests. Digit Symbol Coding and Spatial Span tap attentional capacity, while TMT-A, TMT-B, and Letter Cancellation tap search (or attention-shifting) ability. These five tests can be classified as attention tests.',\n",

The objective was to assess the psychometric properties of the FES-IAB and Short FES-IAB in community-dwelling older people.,A community-dwelling sample of the Dutch population (n\\xa0=\\xa0744) aged 60 and over completed the FES-IAB twice with one month in between (with a follow-up response rate of 92.2%).,Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the unidimensionality of the FES-IAB, with high factor loadings and very good fit. The scale correlated strongly with the FES-I, and moderately with ADL disability and 1-item questions of activity avoidance and CaF. The FES-IAB discriminated well between groups based on age, sex, fall history. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were high (Cronbach's alpha: 0.92, intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.85). FES-IAB scores were positively skewed; 343 people (46.1%) had the lowest possible score of 16. The psychometric properties of the Short FES-IAB were comparable. No problems were identified with the feasibility of the FES-IAB and Short FES-IAB.,Overall, the FES-IAB and Short FES-IAB demonstrated good psychometric properties in assessing activity avoidance due to CaF in community-dwelling older people.

The purpose of this study was to report the accuracy of possible sarcopenia against definitive sarcopenia and the characteristics of false-negative cases.,This was a cross-sectional study using a research registry with outpatients aged =65 years who visited a frailty clinic at a geriatric hospital. The diagnosis of possible sarcopenia and sarcopenia was performed according to the AWGS 2019 criteria, using calf circumference (CC) for case-finding. The accuracy of the diagnosis of sarcopenia in participants with possible sarcopenia was evaluated by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and F-value.,Of the 349 patients (mean age, 78.0±6.0 years; 63% women) analyzed, 86 (24.6%) revealed possible sarcopenia. Possible sarcopenia predicted sarcopenia with a sensitivity of 0.893 and 0.921, specificity of 0.990 and 0.870, and F-values of 0.926 and 0.714 for men and women, respectively. When either the grip strength test or 5-time chair stand test result was examined, the sensitivity of possible sarcopenia to predict sarcopenia decreased, whereas the specificity remained at 0.990-1.000 in men and 0.890-0.940 in women. An extremely decreased CC was identified as a significant characteristic of patients with sarcopenia not detected in the simplified assessment.,The diagnostic accuracy of possible sarcopenia for definitive sarcopenia is excellent.

Energy-adjusted DII score (E-adjusted DII) was calculated using a self-administered diet history questionnaire. Sarcopenia/its components was determined according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia. Serum interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)a, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured.,The mean of E-adjusted DII was 0.13±2.1 (-4.92~5.29) in participants (74.6±5.5 y). After adjustment of confounders, men in the highest tertile of the E-adjusted DII showed a 2.89-times (95% CI: 1.04-8.04) higher risk of sarcopenia than those in the lowest tertile. Regarding its components (low muscle mass/strength/function), men in the highest tertile did not have significantly greater odds, respectively. Intriguingly, when the E-adjusted DII was calculated only based on anti-inflammatory food parameters, men who did not consume food with anti-inflammatory properties scored high E-adjusted DII and were significantly associated with sarcopenia in the highest tertile (OR: 2.96; 95% CI: 1.06-8.93). Higher serum hsCRP levels were seen in sarcopenic men with the highest E-adjusted DII (p=0.036).,These results suggest that a diet with pro-inflammatory potential is associated with the risk of sarcopenia.

Many studies were conducted on their characterization in female breast cancer (FBC), but no information is available on their composition in male breast cancer (MBC). Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a molecular spectroscopy that can rapidly explore the biochemical composition of MCs without requiring any staining protocol. In this study, we optimized an algorithm to identify the mineral components present in MCs from Raman images. The algorithm was then used to study and compare MCs identified on breast cancer pieces from male and female patients. In total, we analyzed 41 MCs from 5 invasive MBC patients and 149 MCs from 13 invasive FBC patients. Results show that hydroxyapatite is the most abundant type of calcium both in MBC and FBC. However, some differences in the amount and distribution of calcium minerals are present between the two groups. Besides, we observed that MCs in MBC have a higher amount of organic material (collagen) than FBC. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first overview of the composition of MCs present in MBC patients; and suggests that these patients have specific features that differentiate them from the previously studied FBC. Our result support thus the need for studies designed explicitly to the understanding of MBC.',\n",

Defects in recombination often lead to sterility. The ubiquitously expressed Rad51 and the meiosis-specific DMC1 are two closely related recombinases that catalyze the key strand invasion and exchange step of meiotic recombination. This study cloned and sequenced the coding region of cattle-yak Rad51 and determined its mRNA and protein expression levels, evaluated its molecular and evolutionary relationship as well as evaluated the histo-morphological structure of testes in the yellow cattle, yak and the sterile cattle-yak hybrid. The Rad51 gene was amplified using PCR, cloned and sequenced using testicular cDNA from yak and cattle-yak. Real-time PCR was used to examine the expression levels of Rad51/DMC1 mRNA in the cattle, yak and cattle-yak testis while western blotting, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry were used to assess the protein expression and localization of Rad51/DMC1 protein in the testicular tissue sections. The results revealed that the mRNA and protein expression of Rad51 and DMC1 are extremely low in the male cattle-yak testis with a corresponding higher incidence of germ cell apoptosis. There was also thinning of the germinal epithelium possibly due to the depletion of the germ cells leading to the widening of the lumen area of the cattle-yak seminiferous tubule. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that the low expression of Rad51 and DMC1 may contribute to the male hybrid sterility in the cattle-yak.',\n",
              " 'Treatment of acute ischemic stroke has been recently improved with the introduction of endovascular mechanical thrombectomy, a minimally invasive procedure able to remove a clot using aspiration devices and/or stent-retrievers. Despite the promising and encouraging results, improvements to the procedure and to the stent design are the focus of the recent efforts. Computational studies can pave the road to these improvements, providing their ability to describe and accurately reproduce a real procedure. A patient with ischemic stroke due to intracranial large vessel occlusion was selected and after the creation of the cerebral vasculature from computed tomography images and a histologic analysis to determine the clot composition, the entire thrombectomy procedure was virtually replicated. As in the real situation, the computational replica showed that two attempts were necessary to remove the clot, as a result of the position of the stent retriever with respect to the clot. Furthermore, the results indicated that clot fragmentation did not occur as the deformations were mainly in a compressive state without the possibility for clot cracks to propagate. The accurate representation of the procedure can be used as an important step for operative optimization planning and future improvements of stent designs.',\n",

Three-dimensional (3D) geometries are reconstructed from 18 control healthy subjects and 15 RCC patients based on Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) images. There is higer in the lumen diameter of the RA (6.21\\xa0±\\xa00.89\\xa0mm) and curvature of the RA (1.2\\xa0±\\xa00.07) in the RCC patient group compared with the control healthy group (4.29\\xa0±\\xa01.08\\xa0mm, 1.1\\xa0±\\xa00.1), respectively. In the hemodynamic analysis, the surface area ratio (%) of low time-averaged wall shear stress (SAR-TAWSS) at the RA (10.65\\xa0±\\xa011.65) and AAA (48.49\\xa0±\\xa012.79) in the RCC patient group is significantly higher than that in the control healthy group (0.23\\xa0±\\xa00.22, 21.57\\xa0±\\xa020.5), respectively. It is found that RCC altered the morphology of the RA in the RCC patient group, which could deteriorate the hemodynamic environment of the RA and AAA. The finding in this study could enhance us to understand the progression of vascular disease caused by RCC.',\n",
              " 'Intra-arterial thrombectomy is a minimally invasive procedure in which an obstructing thrombus (clot) is removed using a minimally-invasive device: a stent-retriever. The stent-retriever is first deployed, and then the thrombus is removed during stent-retriever retraction. This procedure can be simulated using a detailed computational model. However, to be useful for an in silico trial in a clinical setting, model credibility should be demonstrated. The aim of this work is to apply a credibility process for the validation phases to the thrombectomy procedure in order to deem it credible for use in an in silico trial. Validation evidence is proposed for the identified context of use and then used to build credibility to the numerical model. Applicability of the proposed model is justified and assessed using a rigorous step-by-step method based on the ASME V&V40 protocol.',\n",

Here we present a case of PVCs originating from the distal left anterior fascicle (LAF). Activation mapping using a multipolar catheter with small electrodes demonstrated early presystolic Purkinje potentials during the PVCs. A moderately good pace-map match was also obtained near the successful ablation site. This case demonstrates the activation pattern of PVCs originating from the distal LAF and the usefulness of multipolar catheters with small electrodes for the mapping of fascicular PVCs.',\n",

              " 'Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease worldwide; however, disease-modifying treatments are lacking because of the complicated pathological mechanisms. As a breakthrough, aberrant activation of transforming growth factor-ß 1 (TGF-ß1)in subchondral bone has been confirmed as an essential pathomechanism for OA progression, and has become a potential therapeutic target. In addition to R&D on neutralizing antibodies, small-molecule antagonists and chemical medicines, native antagonists of TGF-ß1 could be exploited as another promising approach. Noggin (NOG) is an antagonist of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and was reported to effectively attenuate OA by protecting cartilage and preventing pathological subchondral bone remodeling. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully clarified. We first detected the distribution of NOG in knee joints of an OA mouse model, which showed upregulation at early stage of OA but downregulation later in the subchondral bone and no significant change in the articular cartilage. Furthermore, the interaction between NOG and TGF-ß1 was verified, which in turn suppressed the downstream SMAD2/3 activity of TGF-ß1. Moreover, the proliferation and chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were not significantly influenced by NOG. Taken together, the results showed that NOG antagonized TGF-ß1 but did not repress MSC proliferation and chondrogenesis; thus, it seems promising for OA treatment.',\n",
              " \"Pseudoalteromonas spp. are Gram-negative bacteria which are ubiquitous in marine environments. Our previous work found that there is a classic LuxI/LuxR-type quorum sensing (QS) system which was named YasI/YasR in Pseudoalteromonas sp. R3, but the factors that control QS in strain R3 are unclear yet. Here, we found that the deficiency of hfq encoding RNA chaperon Hfq down-regulated the transcription levels of yasI encoding acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) synthase and yasR encoding AHLs receptor in strain R3. The assay based on fusion reporter of yasI-lacZ showed that Hfq regulates the expression of yasR at both transcriptional and translational levels. In addition, Hfq affects the expression of yasI via yasR. Further analysis indicated that the 5'UTR region of yasR is necessary for Hfq to control QS. In addition, the deletion of hfq increases the unstability of the target yasR mRNA. Based on transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis together with molecular experiments, Hfq-dependent sRNA00002 was identified to be involved in positively regulating QS in Pseudoalternas sp. R3. It was found that sRNA00002 deficiency causes the decrease in expression of yasI and yasR, and thus abolishes the production of AHLs in strain R3. It was concluded that Hfq-dependent sRNA00002 regulates yasR expression by base-pairing with target yasR mRNA at 5'UTR region and altering the stability of yasR mRNA. Our work paves the way for understanding the regulation mechanism of Hfq-dependent sRNAs on QS in Pseudoalteromonas.\",\n",
              " 'Restoration of hair follicle (HF) regenerative capacity is the cornerstone in tissue engineering for the loss of regenerative capacity during in\\xa0vitro expansion of skin-derived precursors (SKPs). Microenvironmental cues facilitated tissue or organ regeneration offers a potential strategy to overcome this difficulty. In our previous work, plantar dermis matrix homogenate (PD) has been proved to induce sweat glands regeneration both in\\xa0vivo and in\\xa0vitro. Here, we found PD also restore regenerative capacity of culture impaired HF spheroids (IHFS). Further, followed by our previous iTRAQ results, the CTHRC1 was identified as a potential regulator in PD facilitated restorative effects in HF regeneration. Knockout of Cthrc1 impaired HF regenerative capacity in spheroids, decreased the diameter of HF in 28 postnatal days mice and shortened invagination of HF bud in 18 days of gestation mice. In IHFS and Cthrc1-/- spheroids, PD partially restored HF regenerative capacity while Cthrc1-/- PD (PDKO) has less or no effect. Taken together, PD is an effective microenvironmental cues for HF regenerative capacity restoration and CTHRC1 played an important role in HF regeneration.',\n",

              " 'A multiplex reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)-based method was designed for the simultaneous detection of different SARS-CoV-2 genes. In this study, we used three target genes encoding for the nucleocapsid 1 and 3 (N1, N3), and the spike (S) proteins, all commonly used in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human and environmental samples. The performance of the multiplex assay, compared to the single assay was assessed for the standard calibration curve, required for absolute quantification, and then, for the real environmental samples to detect SARS-CoV-2. For this latter, four environmental samples were collected at a local wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The results showed that the cycle threshold (Ct) values of the multiplex were comparable to the values obtained by the singleplex PCR. The amplification of the three target genes indicated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the four water samples with an increasing trend in February and these results were confirmed in the multiplex approach, showing the robustness of this method and its applicability for the relative abundance analysis among the samples. Overall, both the laboratory and field work results demonstrated that the multiplex PCR assay developed in this study could provide a method for SARS-CoV-2 detection as robust as the single qPCR, but faster and cost-effective, reducing by three times the number of reactions, and consequently the handling time and reagents.',\n",
              " 'Personal care products (PCPs) are contaminants of emerging concern because of their continuous input into the environment. In this study, membrane bioreactor (MBR) and constructed wetland (CW) methods were used to investigate the effect and mechanism of conventional pollutant and PCP removal from greywater. The effluent of both the MBR- and CW-treated greywater met the reclaimed water reuse standard in China. Conventional pollutants and five target PCPs had a higher removal efficiency in the MBR than in the CW. The removal rates of the PCPs, including Tuina musk (AHTN), were >80% using MBR and CW methods. The main pathway of removing PCPs in the MBR was sludge adsorption and biodegradation, whereas the contribution of the membrane module was weak. The main pathway of removing PCPs in the CW was the combined action of plant absorption, microbial biodegradation, and substrate adsorption, depending on the PCP type. Ethyl hexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC) has strong biological oxidizability and was mainly removed by biodegradation, whereas Jiale musk (HHCB) and AHTN were mainly removed by adsorption. Six types of CW substrates were investigated, and perlite showed the best adsorption effect for the five target PCPs. The optimal substrate adsorption pH was 7. This study provides important technical information on the effective removal of conventional pollutants and PCPs in greywater and the preparation of high-quality reclaimed water.',\n",
              " 'The seaweed industry is growing worldwide to meet future resource needs in terms of food and fuel. In the meantime, the impact of expanding off-bottom seaweed cultivation on its environment is unclear. For example, it remains poorly understood how off-bottom seaweeds affect the local hydrodynamic environment, especially concerning turbulence that is more important for nutrient transport and availability than the mean flow velocity. Here, we carried out well-controlled flume experiments with mimic seaweed thalli, which are available, controllable, and stable, to investigate the impact of off-bottom seaweed canopies on whole-depth flow velocities in terms of both mean flow and turbulence velocity profiles. A careful comparison of behavior in the flow between natural and mimic seaweed thalli was made before these experiments. The results show that the floating seaweed thalli generate a surface boundary layer and have a profound impact on the velocity structure in the bottom boundary layer. More importantly, the generation, growth and dissipation of turbulence in the seaweed thalli area deeply affect the downstream distribution of near-bed turbulent strength and associated bed shear stress. Ignoring this turbulent variation would cause inaccurate predictions of morphological changes of the seabed. Our findings suggest that expanding the seaweed cultivation area may cause high risks of bed degradation and low diffusion in the downstream cultivation area. These findings provide novel insights into the environmental influence of off-bottom seaweed cultivation, with important implications for optimizing management strategies to promote seaweed productivity while minimizing seabed destabilization.',\n",
              " 'Many subtropical coastal wetland vegetation communities are transitioning from herbaceous marsh to woody mangrove, often facilitated by sea-level rise. This study investigated the relationships between vegetation community (upstream marsh, ecotone/transition, and downstream mangrove), salinity (S), and soil biogeochemistry in wetlands along three rivers on the Florida Gulf coast (the Little Manatee, Peace, and Fakahatchee Rivers). Vegetation was surveyed, and soil and water samples were collected during both the dry and the wet season and analyzed for biogeochemical properties (soil: bulk density, pH, organic matter, extractable inorganic and total nutrients, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon; water: inorganic nutrients and DOC) and processes (greenhouse gas production) while salinity and water level were continuously monitored in the field. Results indicated landscape-scale patterns in soil biogeochemistry differed significantly by river and were most strongly correlated with soil organic matter content, regardless of vegetation community or salinity regime. Contrary to expectations, soil organic matter content gradients were not always inversely related to salinity gradients, and methane production was observed in moderate- (S = 12) and high- (S = 34) salinity mangrove communities. The vegetation ecotone experienced seasonally variable salinity and did not serve as a true biogeochemical intermediate between the marsh and mangrove communities. This study demonstrates the need for site-specific studies of biogeochemical gradients in coastal wetlands and indicates the marsh-to-mangrove ecotone is not a proxy for salinity or biogeochemical tipping points. Instead, soil organic matter content is suggested as the most relevant indicator of biogeochemical properties and processes in wetlands along coastal rivers, superseding vegetation community or salinity.',\n",

Before we assessed EC using dynamic causal modelling, we compared three model structures based on the current literature. We enclosed regions of interest that are established for sensory processing during right hand stimulation: Left thalamus, somatosensory, parietal and insular cortex, posterior putamen, and right cerebellum.,The EC analysis revealed task-dependent decreased unidirectional connectivity between the insula and the posterior putamen. The connectivity involving the primary sensory cortex, parietal cortex and cerebellum were not abnormal in WC. The two groups showed no differences in their behavioural data.,Perception and integration of sensory information requires the exchange of information between the insula cortex and the putamen, a sensory process that was disturbed in WC patients.\",\n",
              " 'Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are essential intercellular communicators that are of increasing interest as diagnostic biomarkers. Exploring their biological functions and clinical values, however, remains challenging due to their small sizes and high heterogeneity. Herein, we report an ultrasensitive method that employs target-initiated construction of DNA nanostructure to detect single EVs with an input as low as 100 vesicles/µL. Taking advantage of both DNA nanostructure labeling and EV membrane staining, the method can also permit calibration-free analysis of the protein profiles among different EV samples, leading to clear EV differentiation by their cell of origin. Moreover, this method allows co-localization of dual protein markers on the same EV, and the increased number of EVs carrying dual tumor proteins present in human serum could differentiate cancer patients at the early developmental stage from healthy controls. Our results demonstrate the great potential of this single-EV visualization method in non-invasive detection of the EV-based protein biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring.',\n",

Question items focused on well-being. Participants were stratified into four groups by self-reported CEV status (qualifying condition) and adoption of shielding behavior (baselined at week 1 or 2). The distribution of CEV criteria was reported alongside situational variables and univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Longitudinal trends in physical and mental well-being were displayed graphically. Free-text responses reporting variables impacting well-being were semiquantified using natural language processing. In the lead up to a second national lockdown (October 23, 2020), a follow-up questionnaire evaluated subjective concern if further shielding was advised.,The study included 7240 participants. In the CEV group (n=2391), 1133 (47.3%) assumed shielding behavior at baseline, compared with 633 (13.0%) in the non-CEV group (n=4849). CEV participants who shielded were more likely to be Asian (odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% CI 1.49-2.76), female (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.45), older (OR per year increase 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02), living in a home with an outdoor space (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06-1.70) or three to four other inhabitants (three: OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.15-1.94; four: OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.10-2.01), or solid organ transplant recipients (OR 2.85, 95% CI 2.18-3.77), or have severe chronic lung disease (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.30-2.04). Receipt of a government letter advising shielding was reported in 1115 (46.6%) CEV participants and 180 (3.7%) non-CEV participants, and was associated with adopting shielding behavior (OR 3.34, 95% CI 2.82-3.95 and OR 2.88, 95% CI 2.04-3.99, respectively). In CEV participants, shielding at baseline was associated with a lower rating of mental well-being and physical well-being. Similar results were found for non-CEV participants. Concern for well-being if future shielding was required was most prevalent among CEV participants who had originally shielded.,Future health policy must balance the potential protection from COVID-19 against our findings that shielding negatively impacted well-being and was adopted in many in whom it was not indicated and variably in whom it was indicated. This therefore also requires clearer public health messaging and support for well-being if shielding is to be advised in future pandemic scenarios.',\n",

Data comparing the perioperative outcomes of these two techniques are sparse. Here, the authors hypothesized that outcomes would be similar between patients undergoing SMC and those undergoing ESC and conducted a study using the multicenter Pediatric Craniofacial Surgery Perioperative Registry (PCSPR).,The PCSPR was queried for infants under the age of 6 months who had undergone SMC or ESC for sagittal synostosis. SMC patients were propensity score matched 1:2 with ESC patients on age and weight. Primary outcomes were transfusion-free hospital course, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU length of stay (LOS), and hospital length of stay (HLOS). The authors also obtained data points regarding spring removal. Comparisons of outcomes between matched groups were performed with multivariable regression models.,The query returned data from 676 infants who had undergone procedures from June 2012 through September 2019, comprising 580 ESC infants from 32 centers and 96 SMC infants from 5 centers. Ninety-six SMC patients were matched to 192 ESC patients. There was no difference in transfusion-free hospital course between the two groups (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.78, 95% CI 0.45-1.35). SMC patients were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (aOR 7.50, 95% CI 3.75-14.99) and had longer ICU LOSs (incident rate ratio [IRR] 1.42, 95% CI 1.37-1.48) and HLOSs (IRR 1.28, 95% CI 1.17-1.39).,In this multicenter study of ESC and SMC, the authors found similar transfusion-free hospital courses; however, SMC infants had longer ICU LOSs and HLOSs. A trial comparing longer-term outcomes in SMC versus ESC would further define the roles of these two approaches in the management of sagittal craniosynostosis.',\n",

Inclusion criteria were as follows: English-language studies with patients 2 years of age and younger who had undergone ETV±CPC using rigid or flexible endoscopy for hydrocephalus. The primary outcome was ETV success (i.e., without the need for further CSF diversion procedures). Secondary outcomes included ETV-related and other complications. Statistical significance was determined via independent t-tests and Mood's median tests.,Forty-eight articles met the study inclusion criteria: 37 involving rigid endoscopy, 10 involving flexible endoscopy, and 1 propensity scored-matched comparison. A cumulative 560 patients had undergone 578 rigid ETV±CPC, and 661 patients had undergone 672 flexible ETV±CPC. The flexible endoscopy cohort had a significantly lower average age at the time of the procedure (0.33 vs 0.53 years, p = 0.001) and a lower preoperatively predicted ETV success score (median 40, IQR 32.5-57.5 vs 62.5, IQR 50-70; p = 0.033). Average ETV success rates in the rigid versus flexible groups were 54.98% and 59.65% (p = 0.63), respectively. ETV-related complication rates did not differ significantly at 0.63% for flexible endoscopy and 3.46% for rigid endoscopy (p = 0.30). There was no significant difference in ETV success or complication rate in comparing ETV, ETV+CPC, and ETV with other concurrent procedures.,Despite the lower expected ETV success scores for patients treated with flexible endoscopy, the authors found similar ETV success and complication rates for ETV±CPC with flexible versus rigid endoscopy, as reported in the literature.

              " 'The safety of stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) has been investigated; however, most studies have not differentiated pediatric and adult populations, which have different anatomy and physiology. The purpose of this study was to assess SEEG safety in the pediatric setting, focusing on surgical complications and the identification of patient and surgical risk factors, if any. The authors also aimed to determine whether robot assistance in SEEG was associated with a change in practice, surgical parameters, and clinical outcomes.,The authors retrospectively studied all SEEG cases performed in their department from December 2014 to March 2020. They analyzed both demographic and surgical variables and noted the types of surgery-related complications and their management. They also studied the clinical outcomes of a subset of the patients in relation to robot-assisted and non-robot-assisted SEEG.,Sixty-three children had undergone 64 SEEG procedures. Girls were on average 3 years younger than the boys (mean age 11.1 vs 14.1 years, p < 0.01). The overall complication rate was 6.3%, and the complication rate for patients with left-sided electrodes was higher than that for patients with right-sided electrodes (11.1% vs 3.3%), although the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. The duration of recording was positively correlated to the number of implanted electrodes (r = 0.296, p < 0.05). Robot assistance was associated with a higher number of implanted electrodes (mean 12.6 vs 7.6 electrodes, p < 0.0001). Robot-assisted implantations were more accurate, with a mean error of 1.51 mm at the target compared to 2.98 mm in nonrobot implantations (p < 0.001). Clinical outcomes were assessed in the first 32 patients treated (16 in the nonrobot group and 16 in the robot group), 23 of whom proceeded to further resective surgery. The children who had undergone robot-assisted SEEG had better eventual seizure control following subsequent epilepsy surgery. Of the children who had undergone resective epilepsy surgery, 42% (5/12) in the nonrobot group and 82% (9/11) in the robot group obtained an Engel class IA outcome at 1 year (?2 = 3.885, p = 0.049). Based on Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the robot group had a higher seizure-free rate than the nonrobot group at 30 months postoperation (7/11 vs 2/12, p = 0.063). Two complications, whose causes were attributed to the implantation and head-bandaging steps, required surgical intervention. All complications were either transient or reversible.,This is the largest single-center, exclusively pediatric SEEG series that includes robot assistance so far. SEEG complications are uncommon and usually transient or treatable. Robot assistance enabled implantation of more electrodes and improved epilepsy surgery outcomes, as compared to those in the non-robot-assisted cases.',\n",
              " \"Efficient, reliable and reproducible target volume delineation is a key step in the effective planning of breast radiotherapy. However, post-operative breast target delineation is challenging as the contrast between the tumor bed volume (TBV) and normal breast tissue is relatively low in CT images. In this study, we propose to mimic the marker-guidance procedure in manual target delineation. We developed a saliency-based deep learning segmentation (SDL-Seg) algorithm for accurate TBV segmentation in post-operative breast irradiation. The SDL-Seg algorithm incorporates saliency information in the form of markers' location cues into a U-Net model. The design forces the model to encode the location-related features, which underscores regions with high saliency levels and suppresses low saliency regions. The saliency maps were generated by identifying markers on CT images. Markers' location were then converted to probability maps using a distance transformation coupled with a Gaussian filter. Subsequently, the CT images and the corresponding saliency maps formed a multi-channel input for the SDL-Seg network. Our in-house dataset was comprised of 145 prone CT images from 29 post-operative breast cancer patients, who received 5-fraction partial breast irradiation (PBI) regimen on GammaPod. The 29 patients were randomly split into training (19), validation (5) and test (5) sets. The performance of the proposed method was compared against basic U-Net. Our model achieved mean (standard deviation) of 76.4(±2.7) %, 6.76(±1.83) mm, and 1.9(±0.66) mm for Dice similarity coefficient, 95 percentile Hausdorff distance, and average symmetric surface distance respectively on the test set with computation time of below 11 seconds per one CT volume. SDL-Seg showed superior performance relative to basic U-Net for all the evaluation metrics while preserving low computation cost. The findings demonstrate that SDL-Seg is a promising approach for improving the efficiency and accuracy of the on-line treatment planning procedure of PBI, such as GammaPod based PBI.\",\n",

Early Childhood Education and Care teachers are potential key actors in early interventions to prevent overweight and obesity. This study examines the effects of a preschool-based intervention for teachers in promoting healthy eating and physical activity in young children. A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted at 41 preschools in a deprived area of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The intervention consisted of 2 programmes that were applied in succession: A Healthy Start and PLAYgrounds for TODdlers. The study period was 9 months. Primary outcomes were assessed via questionnaires and included teachers' knowledge, attitude, food/activity-related practices, and level of confidence in promoting healthy behaviours. Secondary outcomes in this study were teachers' and children's BMI (z-score), body composition, dietary intake and physical activity level. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed using linear mixed models. In total, 115 teachers and 249 children (mean age 3.0 (0.2) years) were included. A positive effect on teachers' knowledge about the Dutch dietary guidelines was found after the programme A Healthy Start (difference = 1.38; 1-sided 95% CL = 0.29; p = 0.02). This effect was not sustained at 9 months (difference = 0.34; 1-sided 95% CL = -0.76; p = 0.31). The overall intervention had a positive effect on 3 of the 5 attitude statements regarding a healthy lifestyle (difference ranged from 0.34 to 0.55) and on the practice scale Activity-related-Modelling (difference = 0.16; 1-sided 95% CL = 0.06; p = 0.01). No intervention effects were observed on food-related practice scales and the level of confidence in promoting healthy behaviours. At this stage, no effects were seen on teachers' and children's BMI (z-score). This study contributes to the professional development of Early Childhood Education and Care teachers and addresses the call for interventions to prevent overweight/obesity and to minimise health inequalities in young children.\",\n",

The ecological compensation input of the government and enterprise will produce social reputation, and the ecological compensation of enterprise will also produce advertising effect. Consumer demand will be affected by social reputation and advertising effect. Then, the compensation strategies of the government and enterprise are analyzed by constructing the differential game model. The research shows that under certain conditions, the cost-sharing mechanism can realize the Pareto improvement of the benefits of government, enterprise and the whole system. Under the cooperative mechanism, the benefit of the government, enterprise and the whole system is optimal. Finally, the validity of the conclusion is verified by case analysis, and the sensitivity analysis of the relevant parameters is carried out. The conclusion can provide reference for government to establish sustainable watershed ecological compensation mechanism.',\n",
              " 'Air quality in China has gradually been improving in recent years; however, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region continues to be the most polluted area in China, with the worst air quality index. BTH and its surrounding areas experience high agglomeration of heavy-polluting manufacturers that generate electric power, process petroleum and coal, and carry out smelting and pressing of ferrous metals, raw chemical materials, chemical products, and non-metallic mineral products. This study presents evidence of the air pollution impacts of industrial agglomeration using the Ellison-Glaeser index, Herfindahl-Hirschman index, and spatial autocorrelation analysis. This was based on data from 73,353 enterprises in 2+26 atmospheric pollution transmission channel cities in BTH and its surrounding areas (herein referred to as BTH 2+26 cities). The results showed that Beijing, Yangquan, Puyang, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, and Jinan had the highest Ellison-Glaeser index among the BTH 2+26 cities; this represents the highest enterprise agglomeration. Beijing, Langfang, Tianjin, Baoding, and Tangshan also showed a low Herfindahl-Hirschman index of pollutant emissions, which have a relatively high degree of industrial agglomeration in BTH 2+26 cities. There was an inverted U-shaped relationship between enterprise agglomeration and air quality in the BTH 2+26 cities. This means that air quality improved with increased industrial agglomeration up to a certain level; beyond this point, the air quality begins to deteriorate with a decrease in industrial agglomeration.',\n",
              " 'Hemodynamic monitoring and cardiac output (CO) assessment in the ICU have been trending toward less invasive methods. Carotid blood flow (CBF) was suggested as a candidate for CO assessment. The present study aimed to test the value of carotid artery ultrasound analysis in prediction of mortality in pediatric patients with septic shock.,Forty children with septic shock were included in the study. Upon admission, patients were subjected to careful history taking and thorough clinical examination. The consciousness level was assessed by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Laboratory assessment included complete blood count, C-reactive protein, arterial blood gases, serum electrolytes, and liver and kidney function tests. Electrical cardiometry was used to evaluate hemodynamic parameters. Patients were also subjected to transthoracic 2-D echocardiography. CBF was evaluated using GE Vivid S5 ultrasound device through dedicated software. At the end of study, 14 patients (35.0%) died. It was found that survivors had significantly higher CBF when compared non-survivors [median (IQR): 166.0 (150.0-187.3) versus 141.0 (112.8-174.3), p = 0.033]. In addition, it was noted that survivors had longer ICU stay when compared with non-survivors [16.5 (9.8-31.5) versus 6.5 (3.0-19.5) days, p = 0.005]. ROC curve analysis showed that CBF could significantly distinguish survivors from non-survivors [AUC (95% CI): 0.3 (0.11-0.48), p = 0.035] (Fig 2). Univariate logistic regression analysis identified type of shock [OR (95% CI): 28.1 (4.9-162.4), p<0.001], CI [OR (95% CI): 0.6 (0.43-0.84), p = 0.003] and CBF [OR (95% CI): 0.98 (0.96-0.99), p = 0.031]. However, in multivariate analysis, only type of shock significantly predicted mortality.,CBF assessment may be a useful prognostic marker in children with septic shock.',\n",

Wild-type and Klf15 knockout (Klf15-KO) mice were fed with either high fat diet (HFD, 60% kcal from fat) or normal diet (ND, 10% kcal from fat) for 3\\xa0months and then injected with streptozotocin or vehicle, to induce type 2 diabetes (T2D). All T2D and age-matched control mice were treated with or without SDF-1ß at 5\\xa0mg/kg body-weight twice a week and also continually received HFD or ND for 3\\xa0months. At the end of 6-month study, after cardiac functions were measured, mice were euthanized to collect heart tissue. For in vitro mechanistic study, H9c2 cells were exposed to palmitate to mimic in vivo condition of T2D. SDF-1ß prevented T2D-induced cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis and T2D-down-regulated KLF15 expression in wild-type diabetic heart tissue. However, the preventive effects of SDF-1ß on both KLF15 expression and fibrosis was abolished, with partial cardiac protection in Klf15-KO/T2D mice. These results demonstrate partial KLF15-dependence for SDF-1ß's cardiac fibrotic protection from T2D, but not on SDF-1ß's protective effects on T2D-induced cardiac dysfunction. Further study showed that SDF-1ß inhibited palmitate-induced cardiomyocyte fibrosis through its receptor CXCR7-mediated activation of p38ß MAPK signaling pathway.\",\n",
              " 'This paper presents a generic framework of Model Driven Design (MDD) with its application for a twin screw granulation process using a mechanistic-based population balance model (PBM). The process kernels including nucleation, breakage, layering and consolidation are defined in the PBM. A recently developed breakage kernel is used with key physics incorporated in the model formulation. Prior to granulation experiments, sensitivity analysis of PBM parameters is performed to investigate the variation of model outputs given the input parameter variance. The significance of liquid to solid ratio (L/S ratio), nucleation and breakage parameters is identified by sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis dramatically reduces the number of fitting parameters in PBM and only nine granulation experiments are required for model calibration and validation. A model validation flowchart is proposed to elucidate the evolution of kinetic rate parameters associated with L/S ratio and screw element geometry. The presented MDD framework for sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, model verification and validation can be generalized and applied for any particulate process.',\n",
              " 'This paper presents a comprehensive assessment of the most widely used tablet compaction models in a continuous wet granulation tableting process. The porosity models, tensile strength models and lubricant models are reviewed from the literature and classified based on their formulations i.e. empirical or theoretical and applications, i.e. batch or continuous. The majority of these models are empirical and were initially developed for batch tabletting process. To ascertain their effectiveness and serviceability in the continuous tableting process, a continuous powder processing line of Diamond Pilot Plant (DiPP) installed at The University of Sheffield was used to provide the quantitative data for tablet model assessment. Magnesium stearate (MgSt) is used as a lubricant to investigate its influence on the tensile strength. Whilst satisfactory predictions from the tablet models can be produced, a compromise between the model fidelity and model simplicity needs to be made for a suitable model selection. The Sonnergaard model outperforms amongst the porosity models whilst the Reynolds model produces the best goodness of fitting for two parameters fitting porosity models. An improved tensile strength model is proposed to consider the influence of powder size and porosity in the continuous tableting process.',\n",
              " 'Loss of proprioception has been shown to produce deficits in intralimb coordination and in the ability to stabilize limb posture in the absence of visual feedback. However, the role of proprioceptive signals in the feedforward and feedback control of interlimb coordination remains unclear. To address this issue, we examined bimanual coordination in a deafferented participant (DP) with large-fiber sensory neuropathy, which resulted in the loss of proprioception and touch in both arms, and in age-matched control participants. The task required participants to move a single virtual bar with both hands to a rectangular target with horizontal orientation. The participants received visual feedback of the virtual bar, but not of the hand positions along the bar-axis. Although the task required symmetrical movement between the arms, there were significant differences in the trajectories of the dominant and non-dominant hands in the deafferented participant, and thus more final errors and impaired coordination compared to controls. Deafferentation was also associated with an asymmetric deficit in stabilizing the hand at the end of motion, where the dominant arm showed more drift than the non-dominant arm. While the findings with DP may reflect a unique adaptation to deafferentation, they suggest that 1) Bilateral coordination depends on proprioceptive feedback, and 2) Postural stability at the end of motion can be specified through feedforward mechanisms, in the absence of proprioceptive feedback, but this process appears to be asymmetric, with better stability in the non-dominant arm.',\n",
              " 'Racial categorization of faces has a notable impact on human behavior, but its neural underpinnings remain unresolved. Previous electroencephalography (EEG) research focused on contributions of phase-locked neural activities to racial categorization of faces. We investigated functional roles of non-phase-locked neural oscillations in spontaneous racial categorization of faces by recording EEG from Chinese adults who performed an individuation task on Asian/White faces in Experiment 1 and on Asian/Black faces in Experiment 2. We quantified neural processes involved in spontaneous racial categorization of faces by examining repetition suppression of non-phase-locked neural oscillations when participants viewed faces of one race presented repeatedly in the same block of trials (repetition condition), or faces of two races presented alternately in the same block of trials (alternating condition). We found decreased power of alpha (9-13\\xa0Hz) oscillations in the repetition than alternating conditions at 80-240\\xa0ms over frontal-central electrodes induced by White/Black (but not Asian) faces. Moreover, larger repetition suppression of alpha oscillations in response to White/Black (vs. Asian) faces predicted greater implicit negative attitudes toward White/Black faces across individuals. Our findings suggest that non-phase-locked alpha oscillations are engaged in spontaneous racial categorization of faces and are associated with implicit negative attitudes toward other-race faces.',\n",
              " \"The ATI (Age-Thrombus burden-Index of Microvascular Resistance [IMR]) score was developed to predict suboptimal myocardial reperfusion in patients with ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). When applied in the early phases of revascularization (e.g. before stent insertion), it predicts which patients are most likely to have a larger infarct size. In this study, we assessed the score's utility in determining which STEMI patients are at highest risk of clinical events during follow-up.,The ATI-score was calculated prospectively in 254 STEMI patients using age (>50\\xa0years\\xa0=\\xa01 point), pre-stenting IMR (>40\\xa0U and\\xa0<\\xa0100\\xa0U\\xa0=\\xa01 point; =100\\xa0U\\xa0=\\xa02 points) and angiographic thrombus score (4\\xa0=\\xa01 point, 5\\xa0=\\xa03 points); the cohort was stratified in high vs. low-intermediate ATI-score strata (=4 vs. < 4, respectively).,After 3\\xa0years of follow-up, patients with high ATI-score presented a higher rate of Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) defined as the composite of all-cause mortality, resuscitated cardiac arrest and new heart failure diagnosis (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 3.07; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.19-7.93; p\\xa0=\\xa00.02). The ATI-score showed a moderate discriminative power (c-stat: 0.69), not significantly different from that of other risk scores used in the STEMI setting. A high ATI-score was an independent predictor of MACE (HR: 3.24; 95% CI: 1.22-8.58; p\\xa0=\\xa00.018).,The ATI-score can discriminate patients at higher risk of long-term adverse events. The score allows predication of subsequent events even before coronary stenting, and consequently it may allow the option of individualized therapy in the early stages of the clinical care-pathway.\",\n",
              " 'Lifelong auditory and visual sensory deprivation have been demonstrated to alter both perceptual acuity and the neural processing of remaining senses. Recently, it was demonstrated that individuals with anosmia, i.e. complete olfactory sensory deprivation, displayed enhanced multisensory integration performance. Whether this ability is due to a reorganization of olfactory processing regions to focus on cross-modal multisensory information or whether it is due to enhanced processing within multisensory integration regions is not known. To dissociate these two outcomes, we investigated the neural processing of dynamic audio-visual stimuli in individuals with congenital anosmia and matched controls (both groups, n\\xa0=\\xa033) using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Specifically, we assessed whether the previously demonstrated multisensory enhancement is related to cross-modal processing of multisensory stimuli in olfactory associated regions, the piriform and olfactory orbitofrontal cortices, or enhanced multisensory processing in established multisensory integration regions, the superior temporal and intraparietal sulci. No significant group differences were found in the a priori hypothesized regions using region of interest analyses. However, exploratory whole-brain analysis suggested higher activation related to multisensory integration within the posterior superior temporal sulcus, in close proximity to the multisensory region of interest, in individuals with congenital anosmia. No group differences were demonstrated in olfactory associated regions. Although results were outside our hypothesized regions, combined, they tentatively suggest that enhanced processing of audio-visual stimuli in individuals with congenital anosmia may be mediated by multisensory, and not primary sensory, cerebral regions.',\n",

In this study, we discuss a strategy combining ARTP mutagenesis and high-throughput screening to engineer Corynebacterium glutamicum towards high yield production of heterologous proteins. First, three target strains, MC2, MA8, and MA6, were screened from the mutant library with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as the reporter protein, and their growth stability and the influence of heterologous protein production were verified. Second, genes encoding three high-value medicinal proteins (glycoprotein D, gD; endoxylanase, XynA; and variable domain of heavy chain of heavy-chain antibody, VHH) were expressed in the mutagenized strain, which confirmed its applicability for an increased biosynthesis of other heterologous proteins. During the large-scale fermentation of C. glutamicum for VHH production, the fermentation characteristics of the best mutant MA6 were verified. Compared to the original strain, the yield of VHH obtained with strain MA6 was increased by nearly 91 % to approximately 862 mg/L. Finally, through systematic genome analysis mutations in five genes were obtained. These genes code for putative proteases or are potentially related to the bacterial restriction repair systems. These findings will help to obtain optimized chassis cells and provide a direction for in-depth research on genetic targets that can increase protein production.',\n",
              " 'Oxidative stability of radiation crosslinked ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) artificial joints is significantly improved by vitamin E (VE), but there is a dilemma that VE hinders crosslinking and thus jeopardizes the wear of UHMWPE. In this effort, we proposed an efficient strategy to stabilize UHMWPE under limited antioxidant contents, where VE and D-sorbitol (DS) were used as the primary antioxidant and the secondary antioxidant respectively. For non-irradiated blends with fixed antioxidant contents, oxidative stability accessed by oxidation induction time (OIT) of VE/DS/UHMWPE blends was superior to that of VE/UHMWPE blends, while DS/UHMWPE blends showed no increase in OIT. The cooperation between DS and VE exhibited a synergistic effect on enhancing the oxidative stability of UHMWPE. Interestingly, the irradiated VE/DS/UHMWPE blends showed comparable OIT but a significantly higher crosslink density than the irradiated VE/UHMWPE blends. The crystallinity, melting point, and in vitro biocompatibility of the blends were not affected by VE and DS. The quantitative relationships of mechanical properties, oxidation stability, crystallinity and crosslink density were established to unveil the correlation of these key factors. The overall properties of VE/UHMWPE and VE/DS/UHMWPE blends were compared to elucidate the superiority of the antioxidant compounding strategy. These findings provide a paradigm to break the trade-off between oxidative stability, crosslink density and mechanical properties, which is constructive to develop UHMWPE bearings with upgraded performance for total joint replacements. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: VE-stabilized UHMWPE is the most commonly used material in total joint replacements at present. However, oxidation and wear resistance of VE/UHMWPE implants cannot be unified since VE reduces the efficiency of radiation crosslinking. It limits the use of VE. Herein, we proposed a compounding stabilization by the synergy between VE and DS. The antioxidation capability of VE was revived by DS, thus enhancing the oxidation stability of unirradiated UHMWPE. The irradiated VE/DS/UHMWPE exhibited similar oxidation stability but higher crosslink density than irradiated VE/UHMWPE, which is beneficial to combat wear of UHMWPE and to inhibit the occurrence of osteolysis. This synergistic antioxidation strategy endows the UHMWPE joint material with good overall performance, which is of clinical significance.',\n",
              " 'Additively manufactured biodegradable porous iron has been only very recently demonstrated. Two major limitations of such a biomaterial are very low biodegradability and incompatibility with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here, we present a novel biomaterial that resolves both of those limitations. We used extrusion-based 3D printing to fabricate ex situ-alloyed biodegradable iron-manganese scaffolds that are non-ferromagnetic and exhibit enhanced rates of biodegradation. We developed ink formulations containing iron and 25, 30, or 35 wt% manganese powders, and debinding and sintering process to achieve Fe-Mn scaffolds with 69% porosity. The Fe25Mn scaffolds had the e-martensite and ?-austenite phases, while the Fe30Mn and Fe35Mn scaffolds had only the ?-austenite phase. All iron-manganese alloys exhibited weakly paramagnetic behavior, confirming their potential to be used as MRI-friendly bone substitutes. The in vitro biodegradation rates of the scaffolds were very much enhanced (i.e., 4.0 to 4.6 times higher than that of porous iron), with the Fe35Mn alloy exhibiting the highest rate of biodegradation (i.e., 0.23 mm/y). While the elastic moduli and yield strengths of the scaffolds decreased over 28 days of in vitro biodegradation, those values remained in the range of cancellous bone. The culture of preosteoblasts on the porous iron-manganese scaffolds revealed that cells could develop filopodia on the scaffolds, but their viability was reduced by the effect of biodegradation. Altogether, this research marks a major breakthrough and demonstrates the great prospects of multi-material extrusion-based 3D printing to further address the remaining issues of porous iron-based materials and, eventually, develop ideal bone substitutes. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: 3D printed porous iron biomaterials for bone substitution still encounter limitations, such as the slow biodegradation and magnetic resonance imaging incompatibility. Aiming to solve the two fundamental issues of iron, we present ex-situ alloyed porous iron-manganese scaffolds fabricated by means of multi-material extrusion-based 3D printing. Our porous iron-manganese possessed enhanced biodegradability, non-ferromagnetic property, and bone-mimicking mechanical property throughout the in vitro biodegradation period. The results demonstrated a great prospect of multi-material extrusion-based 3D printing to further address the remaining challenges of porous iron-based biomaterials to be an ideal biodegradable bone substitutes.',\n",
              " 'Egg glue proteins (EGPs) are produced by female insects, which can make the eggs firmly attached to the oviposition sites, not affected by wind and rain. Although EGPs are widespread in insects, they have been rarely characterized in molecular detail. Here, the full-length sequence and secondary structure of silkworm EGP is reported. A pentapeptide motif, G-G-N/K/D-Q/E/K-Q/P, was found to repeat 346 times, forming a hydrophilic and elastic ß-spiral structure in the silkworm EGP. To reveal the adhesive property and mechanism, we extracted natural EGP from silkworm colleterial gland, and expressed recombinant EGP in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. The glycosylated natural EGP and recombinant EGP from P. pastoris was found to have better adhesive strength than the non-glycosylated recombinant EGP from E. coli. In addition, two transglutaminases in the colleterial gland were found to contribute to the high adhesion of EGP by catalyzing the cross-linking. This study provides important insights into the structure-function relationships associated with this protein, thereby creating new opportunities for the use of insect EGP as a biomaterial. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Egg glue proteins are produced by female insects, which can make the eggs firmly attached to the oviposition sites, not affected by wind and rain. However, genes encoding insect egg glue proteins have not yet been reported, and the molecular mechanism underpinning their adhesion is still unknown. Our study makes a significant contribution to the literature as it identifies the sequence, structure, adhesive property, and mechanism of silkworm egg glue protein. Furthermore, it outlines key insights into the structure-function relationships associated with egg glue proteins. We believe that this paper will be of interest to the readership of your journal as it identifies the first complete sequence of insect egg glue proteins, thereby highlighting their potentials future applications in both the biomedical and technical fields.',\n",

However, changes in telomere length (TL) in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndrome are unclear. Accordingly, in this study, we assessed TL in blood samples from patients with FTD syndrome.,Absolute TL was measured in peripheral blood leukocytes from 53 patients with FTD syndromes (25 with behavioral variant FTD, 19 with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia [PPA], six with nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA, and three with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS] plus) and 28 cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls using terminal restriction fragment analysis.,TL was significantly longer in the FTD group than in the CU group. All FTD subtypes had significantly longer TL than controls. There were no significant differences in TL among FTD syndromes. No significant correlations were found between TL and demographic factors in the FTD group.,Longer telomeres were associated with FTD syndrome, consistent with a recent report demonstrating that longer telomeres are related to ALS. Therefore, our results may support a shared biology between FTD and ALS. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed.\",\n",

Caregiver education is a primary goal in discharge planning to ensure safe, competent home care for these medically fragile children. Standard of care is bedside teaching. The Family Tracheostomy Program complements traditional training with a phased process of simulation. The purpose of this QA/QI project was to increase caregiver competency and decrease anxiety level for pediatric tracheostomy care through simulation training.,For two years, the pediatric and neonatal intensive care units trained twenty caregivers of new tracheostomy patients with the supplementation of simulation to standard bedside training. Using a five-point rating scale, caregivers completed pre- and post- tests for separate skills and scenario training sessions.,Skills scores were hypothesized to increase after simulation training.

              " 'Human V?9Vd2 T cells recognize pyrophosphates produced by microbes and transformed cells and play a role in anti-infective immunity and tumor surveillance. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are pattern recognition receptors in innate immune cells which sense microbial structures including nucleic acids. Given that ?d T cells are in clinical development for application in cellular cancer immunotherapy and TLR ligands have potent adjuvant activity, we investigated the co-stimulatory role of selected TLR ligands in ?d T-cell activation. Here we have used recently described RNA ligands for TLR7 and TLR8 together with V?9Vd2 T-cell specific pyrophosphate antigens to analyze the rapid cytokine induction in Vd2 T cells as well as the accessory cell requirements. While TLR8- as well as TLR7/8-specific RNA did not induce IFN-? in Vd2 T cells on their own, they provided strong co-stimulation for Vd2 T cells within peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the presence of additional T-cell receptor activation. In contrast, TLR7 ligands were ineffective. Purified ?d T cells did not directly respond to TLR8 co-stimulation but required the presence of monocytes. Further experiments revealed a critical role of IL-1ß and IL-18, and to a slightly lesser extent of IL-12p70, in the co-stimulation of Vd2 T cells by TLR8 and TLR7/8 RNA ligands. Results of intracellular cytokine expression were validated by ELISA analysis of cytokines in cell culture supernatants. The cell context-dependent adjuvant activity of TLR8 and TLR7/8 RNA ligands described here might be important for the future optimization of ?d T-cell based cancer immunotherapy.',\n",

This study sought to assess the role of peripheral blood VEGF and some inflammation biomarkers in evaluating clinical response and prognosis in patients with non-operative esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).

VEGF expression in the peripheral blood was detected and related inflammation biomarkers such as GPS, CAR and CLR were counted. Logistic regression and Cox regression were implemented respectively to analyze the correlation of each predictor with clinical response and prognosis. The performance of combined testing was estimated using AUCs. Based on independent predictors, a nomogram prediction model was established to predict the probabilities of 1- and 2-year PFS of patients. The effectiveness of the nomogram model was characterized by C-index, AUC, calibration curves and DCA. VEGF and CLR levels at the end of radiotherapy were independent predictors of clinical response, while VEGF and GPS levels at 3\\xa0months after radiotherapy were independent prognostic predictors. The efficacy of combined detection of VEGF and CLR is superior to the single detection in evaluating clinical response and prognosis. The nomogram showed excellent accuracy in predicting PFS. The combined detection of VEGF and CLR at the end of radiotherapy can be used to evaluate the clinical response of patients with non-operative ESCC, and the combined detection of VEGF and GPS 3\\xa0months after radiotherapy can be used to predict the prognosis. Implemented by nomogram model, it is expected to provide practical and reliable method to evaluate the clinical response and prognosis of patients with non-operative ESCC tool.',\n",

The aim of the study is to identify combination of factors facilitating SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of control measures in a dormitory through extensive epidemiological, serological and phylogenetic investigations, supported by simulation models. Our findings showed that asymptomatic cases and symptomatic cases who did not seek medical attention were major drivers of the outbreak. Furthermore, each resident had about 30 close contacts and each infected resident spread to 4.4 (IQR 3.5-5.3) others at the start of the outbreak. The final attack rate of the current outbreak was 76.2% (IQR 70.6-98.0%) and could be reduced by further 10% under a modified dormitory housing condition. These findings are important when designing living environments in a post COVID-19 future to reduce disease spread and facilitate rapid implementation of outbreak control measures.',\n",
              " \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and heterogeneous disease that can be affected by various genetic factors. Although the cause of AD is not yet known and there is no treatment to cure this disease, its progression can be delayed. AD has recently been recognized as a brain-specific type of diabetes called type 3 diabetes. Several studies have shown that people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have a higher risk of developing AD. Therefore, it is important to identify subgroups of patients with AD that may be more likely to be associated with T2D. We here describe a new approach to identify the correlation between AD and T2D at the genetic level. Subgroups of AD and T2D were each generated using a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) approach, which generated clusters containing subsets of genes and samples. In the gene cluster that was generated by conventional gene clustering method from NMF, we selected genes with significant differences in the corresponding sample cluster by Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn-test. Subsequently, we extracted differentially expressed gene (DEG) subgroups, and candidate genes with the same regulation direction can be extracted at the intersection of two disease DEG subgroups. Finally, we identified 241 candidate genes that represent common features related to both AD and T2D, and based on pathway analysis we propose that these genes play a role in the common pathological features of AD and T2D. Moreover, in the prediction of AD using logistic regression analysis with an independent AD dataset, the candidate genes obtained better prediction performance than DEGs. In conclusion, our study revealed a subgroup of patients with AD that are associated with T2D and candidate genes associated between AD and T2D, which can help in providing personalized and suitable treatments.\",\n",
              " \"COVID-19 has widely spread around the world, impacting the health systems of several countries in addition to the collateral damage that societies will face in the next years. Although the comparison between countries is essential for controlling this disease, the main challenge is the fact of countries are not simultaneously affected by the virus. Therefore, from the COVID-19 dataset by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, we present a temporal analysis on the number of new cases and deaths among countries using artificial intelligence. Our approach incrementally models the cases using a hierarchical clustering that emphasizes country transitions between infection groups over time. Then, one can compare the current situation of a country against others that have already faced previous waves. By using our approach, we designed a transition index to estimate the most probable countries' movements between infectious groups to predict next wave trends. We draw two important conclusions: (1) we show the historical infection path taken by specific countries and emphasize changing points that occur when countries move between clusters with small, medium, or large number of cases; (2) we estimate new waves for specific countries using the transition index.\",\n",

We independently manipulated an intramaze cue or the environment's boundary in a navigation task in 27 younger children (6-8\\xa0years), 30 older children (10-13\\xa0years), 29 adolescents (15-17\\xa0years), 29 younger adults (20-35\\xa0years) and 26 older adults (65-80\\xa0years) to investigate lifespan age differences in the relative prioritization of either information. Whereas learning based on an intramaze cue showed earlier maturation during the progression from younger to later childhood and remained relatively stable across adulthood, maturation of boundary-based learning was more protracted towards peri-adolescence and showed strong aging-related decline. Furthermore, individual differences in prioritizing intramaze cue- over computationally more demanding boundary-based learning was positively associated with cognitive processing fluctuations and this association was partially mediated by spatial working memory capacity during adult, but not during child development. This evidence reveals different age gradients of two modes of spatial learning across the lifespan, which seem further influenced by individual differences in cognitive processing fluctuations and working memory, particularly during aging.\",\n",
              " \"In order to understand the effect of cellular level features on the transport of circulating cancer cells in the microcirculation, there has been an increasing reliance on high-resolution in silico models. Accurate simulation of cancer cells flowing with blood cells requires resolving cellular-scale interactions in 3D, which is a significant computational undertaking warranting a cancer cell model that is both computationally efficient yet sufficiently complex to capture relevant behavior. Given that the characteristics of metastatic spread are known to depend on cancer type, it is crucial to account for mechanistic behavior representative of a specific cancer's cells. To address this gap, in the present work we develop and validate a means by which an efficient and popular membrane model-based approach can be used to simulate deformable cancer cells and reproduce experimental data from specific cell lines. Here, cells are modeled using the immersed boundary method (IBM) within a lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) fluid solver, and the finite element method (FEM) is used to model cell membrane resistance to deformation. Through detailed comparisons with experiments, we (i) validate this model to represent cancer cells undergoing large deformation, (ii) outline a systematic approach to parameterize different cell lines to optimally fit experimental data over a range of deformations, and (iii) provide new insight into nucleated vs. non-nucleated cell models and their ability to match experiments. While many works have used the membrane-model based method employed here to model generic cancer cells, no quantitative comparisons with experiments exist in the literature for specific cell lines undergoing large deformation. Here, we describe a phenomenological, data-driven approach that can not only yield good agreement for large deformations, but explicitly detail how it can be used to represent different cancer cell lines. This model is readily incorporated into cell-resolved hemodynamic transport simulations, and thus offers significant potential to complement experiments towards providing new insights into various aspects of cancer progression.\",\n",
              " \"In order to provide valuable guidelines for the conservation of germplasm of Lateolabrax maculatus, the genetic diversity and population structure analysis were evaluated for eight geographic populations along coastal regions of China, using 11 microsatellite DNA markers. The genetic parameters obtained showed that, eight populations can be clustered into two groups, the Northern group and the Southern group, concordant with their geographical positions. The UPGMA tree constructed according to the Nei's genetic distance along with the structure analysis and discriminant analysis of principal component also supported this result. This might be explained by the geographic separation and the divergent environmental conditions among the populations. It's worth noting that, QD (Qingdao) population from northern area was assigned to the Southern group and showed a close genetic relationship and similar genetic constitution with the southern populations. We speculated that large scales of anthropogenic transportation of wild fries from QD populations to the southern aquaculture areas in history should be the primary cause. The populations from GY (Ganyu), RD (Rudong) and BH (Binhai) had higher genetic diversity and showed limited genetic exchange with other populations, indicating better conservation of the natural resources in these regions. All populations were indicated to have experienced bottleneck events in history.\",\n",
              " 'Neonicotinoids are insecticides widely used as seed treatments that appear to have multiple negative effects on birds at a diversity of biological scales. Adult birds exposed to a low dose of imidacloprid, one of the most commonly used neonicotinoids, presented reduced fat stores, delayed migration and potentially altered orientation. However, little is known on the effect of imidacloprid on birds growth rate despite studies that have documented disruptive effects of low imidacloprid doses on thyroid gland communication. We performed a [Formula: see text] factorial design experiment in Zebra finches, in which nestling birds were exposed to a very low dose (0.205\\xa0mg\\xa0kg body [Formula: see text]) of imidacloprid combined with food restriction during posthatch development. During the early developmental period, imidacloprid exposure resulted in an improvement of body condition index in treated nestlings relative to controls. Imidacloprid also led to compensatory growth in food restricted nestlings. This early life neonicotinoid exposure also carried over to adult age, with exposed birds showing higher lean mass and basal metabolic rate than controls at ages of 90-800\\xa0days. This study presents the first evidence that very low-dose neonicotinoid exposure during early life can permanently alter adult phenotype in birds.',\n",
              " 'The a priori T cell repertoire and immune response against SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens may explain the varying clinical course and prognosis of patients having a mild COVID-19 infection as opposed to those developing more fulminant multisystem organ failure and associated mortality. Using a novel SARS-Cov-2-specific artificial antigen presenting cell (aAPC), coupled with a rapid expansion protocol (REP) as practiced in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) therapy, we generate an immune catalytic quantity of Virus Induced Lymphocytes (VIL). Using T cell receptor (TCR)-specific aAPCs carrying co-stimulatory molecules and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 peptide-pentamer complexes, we expand virus-specific VIL derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of convalescent COVID-19 patients up to 1000-fold. This is achieved in a clinically relevant 7-day vein-to-vein time-course as a potential adoptive cell therapy (ACT) for COVID-19. We also evaluate this approach for other viral pathogens using Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific VIL from donors as a control. Rapidly expanded VIL are enriched in virus antigen-specificity and show an activated, polyfunctional cytokine profile and T effector memory phenotype which may contribute to a robust immune response. Virus-specific T cells can also be delivered allogeneically via MHC-typing and patient human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matching to provide pragmatic treatment in a large-scale therapeutic setting. These data suggest that VIL may represent a novel therapeutic option that warrants further clinical investigation in the armamentarium against COVID-19 and other possible future pandemics.',\n",

To compensate for the small size of the dataset, digitally reconstructed radiography (DRR) images generated from CT were used as training data instead of actual X-ray images. The DRR-like images were generated from actual X-ray images in the test and adapted to the network, and high-accuracy estimation of a 3D bone model from a small data set was possible.

              " 'Weight gain is a frequent and severe adverse reaction in patients taking antipsychotics. The objective was to further investigate in a natural setting influential risk factors associated with clinically significant weight gain. An observational follow-up study was conducted. Patients when initiating treatment with whatever antipsychotic were included; a structured questionnaire was applied at baseline, 3 and 6\\xa0months later; a blood sample was obtained. In a nested case-control approach, patients with an increase = 7% of their initial weight were considered as cases, the remaining, as controls. The results showed that, out of 185 patients, 137 completed the 6-month follow-up (cases, 38; controls, 99). Weight gain gradually and significantly increased in cases (baseline, 65.0\\xa0kg; 6\\xa0months, 74.0\\xa0kg) but not in controls (65.6\\xa0kg and 65.8\\xa0kg, respectively). Age (adjusted OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.96-0.99, p = 0.004), olanzapine (adjusted OR = 2.98, 95% CI = 1.13-7.80, p = 0.027) and quetiapine (adjusted OR = 0.25, 95% = 0.07-0.92, p = 0.037) significantly associated with weight gain. An association was also found for the CNR1 (rs1049353) and INSIG2 (rs7566605) polymorphisms. In conclusion, an increased risk of antipsychotics-induced weight gain was observed for younger age and olanzapine, and a relative lower risk for quetiapine. A potential role of CNR1 rs1049353 and INSIG2 rs7566605 polymorphisms is suggested.',\n",
              " 'Targeted DNA methylation is a technique that aims to methylate cytosines in selected genomic loci. In the most widely used approach a CG-specific DNA methyltransferase (MTase) is fused to a sequence specific DNA binding protein, which binds in the vicinity of the targeted CG site(s). Although the technique has high potential for studying the role of DNA methylation in higher eukaryotes, its usefulness is hampered by insufficient methylation specificity. One of the approaches proposed to suppress methylation at unwanted sites is to use MTase variants with reduced DNA binding affinity. In this work we investigated how methylation specificity of chimeric MTases containing variants of the CG-specific prokaryotic MTase M.SssI fused to zinc finger or dCas9 targeting domains is influenced by mutations affecting catalytic activity and/or DNA binding affinity of the MTase domain. Specificity of targeted DNA methylation was assayed in E. coli harboring a plasmid with the target site. Digestions of the isolated plasmids with methylation sensitive restriction enzymes revealed that specificity of targeted DNA methylation was dependent on the activity but not on the DNA binding affinity of the MTase. These results have implications for the design of strategies of targeted DNA methylation.',\n",
              " \"Blood circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are proposed to be promising biomarkers for many neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there is a lack of identified differentially expressed miRNAs in PD from different studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate miRNAs expression in PD. We measured plasma circulating miRNA expression in three independent sets with a total of 151 PD patients, 21 multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients and 138 healthy controls using high-throughput RT-PCR. We identified that elevated miR-133b and miR-221-3p discriminated early-stage PD from controls with 94.4% sensitivity and 91.1% specificity. Elevated miR-133b and miR-221-3p distinguished PD from controls with 84.8% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. In addition, miR-4454 distinguished PD from MSA with 57.1% sensitivity and 82.6% specificity. Hence, elevated miR-133b and miR-221-3p potentially represent good biomarkers for early PD, and a combination of miR-133b, miR-221-3p and miR-4454 has the potential to serve as a non-invasive biomarker for PD diagnosis.\",\n",

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of fatigue in IBD and its relation with potential causative factors. A survey on fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and the presence of sarcopenia and malnutrition, was sent by email to 244 IBD outpatients of the Gastroenterology Unit of Academic Hospital of Padua. Demographics and clinical data, including the levels of fecal calprotectin (FC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and current pharmacological treatments were obtained from patients' medical records. Ninety-nine (40.5%) subjects answered the survey. Ninety-two (92.9%) patients reported fatigue, with sixty-six having mild to moderate fatigue and twenty-six severe fatigue. Multivariate analysis showed that abnormal values of CRP (OR 5.1), severe anxiety (OR 3.7) and sarcopenia (OR 4.4) were the factors independently associated with severe fatigue. Fatigue has a high prevalence in subject affected by IBD. Subjects with altered CRP, sarcopenia and severe anxiety appear more at risk of severe fatigue.\",\n",
              " 'Although music therapy may engender clinical benefits in patients with neurodegenerative disease, the impacts of social and musical factors of such activities on socio-emotional and motor engagements are poorly understood. To address this issue, non-verbal behaviors of 97 patients with or without major cognitive impairment (CI) were assessed when listening to music or a metronome in front of a musician who was present physically (live) or virtually (video). Socio-emotional engagement was quantified as emotional facial expression production and gaze direction. Motor engagement was quantified as overall body motion and the production of rhythmic movements. In both groups, positive facial expressions were more frequent and rhythmic motor activities lasted longer with music than with a metronome, and during a live performance rather than a video performance. Relative to patients without CI, patients with CI moved less with music, expressed fewer emotions, and spent less time looking at the musician in the video condition and in the metronome condition. The relative reductions in motor and socio-emotional engagements in patients with CI might be markers of disease progression. However, the presence of a live partner induces older adults to engage emotionally and physically in musical activities emphasizing the relevance of using live performance as motivational levers during music therapy.',\n",
              " \"The use of Augmented Reality (AR) in anatomical education has been promoted by numerous authors. Next to financial and ethical advantages, AR has been described to decrease cognitive load while increasing student motivation and engagement. Despite these advantages, the effects of AR on learning outcome varies in different studies and an overview and aggregated outcome on learning anatomy is lacking. Therefore, a meta-analysis on the effect of AR vs. traditional anatomical teaching methods on learning outcome was performed. Systematic database searches were conducted by two independent investigators using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. This yielded five papers for meta-analysis totaling 508 participants; 240 participants in the AR-groups and 268 participants in the control groups. (306 females/202 males). Meta-analysis showed no significant difference in anatomic test scores between the AR group and the control group (- 0.765 percentage-points (%-points); P = 0.732). Sub analysis on the use of AR vs. the use of traditional 2D teaching methods showed a significant disadvantage when using AR (- 5.685%-points; P = 0.024). Meta-regression analysis showed no significant co-relation between mean difference in test results and spatial abilities (as assessed by the mental rotations test scores). Student motivation and/or engagement could not be included since studies used different assessment tools. This meta-analysis showed that insufficient evidence is present to conclude AR significantly impacts learning outcome and that outcomes are significantly impacted by students' spatial abilities. However, only few papers were suitable for meta-analysis, indicating that there is a need for more well-designed, randomized-controlled trials on AR in anatomy education research.\",\n",

              " 'Many western countries used shielding (extended self-isolation) of people presumed to be at high-risk from COVID-19 to protect them and reduce healthcare demand. To investigate the effectiveness of this strategy, we linked family practitioner, prescribing, laboratory, hospital and death records and compared COVID-19 outcomes among shielded and non-shielded individuals in the West of Scotland. Of the 1.3 million population, 27,747 (2.03%) were advised to shield, and 353,085 (26.85%) were classified a priori as moderate risk. COVID-19 testing was more common in the shielded (7.01%) and moderate risk (2.03%) groups, than low risk (0.73%). Referent to low-risk, the shielded group had higher confirmed infections (RR 8.45, 95% 7.44-9.59), case-fatality (RR 5.62, 95% CI 4.47-7.07) and population mortality (RR 57.56, 95% 44.06-75.19). The moderate-risk had intermediate confirmed infections (RR 4.11, 95% CI 3.82-4.42) and population mortality (RR 25.41, 95% CI 20.36-31.71) but, due to their higher prevalence, made the largest contribution to deaths (PAF 75.30%). Age = 70\\xa0years accounted for 49.55% of deaths. In conclusion, in spite of the shielding strategy, high risk individuals were at increased risk of death. Furthermore, to be effective as a population strategy, shielding criteria would have needed to be widely expanded to include other criteria, such as the elderly.',\n",
              " 'Vaccination can prevent viral infections via virus-specific T cells, among other mechanisms. A goal of oncolytic virotherapy is replication of oncolytic viruses (OVs) in tumors, so pre-existing T cell immunity against an OV-encoded transgene would seem counterproductive. We developed a treatment for melanomas by pre-vaccinating against an oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-encoded tumor antigen. Surprisingly, when the VSV-vectored booster vaccine was administered at the peak of the primary effector T cell response, oncolysis was not abrogated. We sought to determine how oncolysis was retained during a robust T cell response against the VSV-encoded transgene product. A murine melanoma model was used to identify two mechanisms that enable this phenomenon. First, tumor-infiltrating T cells had reduced cytopathic potential due to immunosuppression. Second, virus-induced lymphopenia acutely removed virus-specific T cells from tumors. These mechanisms provide a window of opportunity for replication of oncolytic VSV and rationale for a paradigm change in oncolytic virotherapy, whereby immune responses could be intentionally induced against a VSV-encoded melanoma-associated antigen to improve safety without abrogating oncolysis.',\n",

We examined the effects of passive stretching on muscle mass, myofiber cross-sectional area, muscle fiber type composition, satellite cell and myonuclei content, signaling pathways involved in muscle protein synthesis, and myogenic regulatory factors. The gastrocnemius muscle weight and fiber cross-sectional area of the stretched side was found greater compared with that of the unstretched side. Passive repetitive stretching increased the mRNA expression level of Akt, p70S6K, 4E-BP1, Myf5, myogenin, MuRF1.The phosphorylation level of p70S6K significantly increased in the stretched muscles, whereas of Akt and 4E-BP1 remained unchanged, compared to the unstretched side. The Pax7+ cells and myonuclei content did not differ between the stretched and unstretched muscles. These findings suggest that the hypertrophic or suppressed atrophic observation in the stretched muscles are mainly attributable to the protein turnover provoked by stretching. These findings are applicable to clinical muscle strengthening and sarcopenia prevention.',\n",

This is the first report on isolation and assessment of probiotic capabilities of L. plantarum strains isolated from rhizospheric soil. The isolates were confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and named as NS14, NS16 and NGG. All the isolates were evaluated for bile salt hydrolysis, hypocholestrolemic potential and probiotic attributes. Our results indicated that all the strains harboured bsh and showed in vitro cholesterol assimilation capabilities which increased when bile salts were also present in the culture medium. Also, all the strains remained viable at high temperatures and in the presence of NaCl, lysozyme, simulated gastric juice, bile salts and, exhibited auto- and co-aggregation capabilities. Additionally, L. plantarum strain NS14 survived in the presence of phenols, acidic environment (pH 2-3) and was resistant to many clinically relevant antibiotics. Since, L. plantarum NS14 exhibited most of the desirable and essential characteristics of a probiotic it should be further investigated as a potent probiotic with an additional benefit as a hypocholesterolemic biotherapeutic.

              " \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a very frequent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by an accumulation of amyloid-ß (Aß). Acitretin, a retinoid-derivative and approved treatment for Psoriasis vulgaris, increases non-amyloidogenic Amyloid-Precursor-Protein-(APP)-processing, prevents Aß-production and elicits cognitive improvement in AD mouse models. As an unintended side effect, acitretin could result in hyperlipidemia. Here, we analyzed the impact of acitretin on the lipidome in brain and liver tissue in the 5xFAD mouse-model. In line with literature, triglycerides were increased in liver accompanied by increased PCaa, plasmalogens and acyl-carnitines, whereas SM-species were decreased. In brain, these effects were partially enhanced or similar but also inverted. While for SM and plasmalogens similar effects were found, PCaa, TAG and acyl-carnitines showed an inverse effect in both tissues. Our findings emphasize, that potential pharmaceuticals to treat AD should be carefully monitored with respect to lipid-homeostasis because APP-processing itself modulates lipid-metabolism and medication might result in further and unexpected changes. Moreover, deducing effects of brain lipid-homeostasis from results obtained for other tissues should be considered cautiously. With respect to acitretin, the increase in brain plasmalogens might display a further positive probability in AD-treatment, while other results, such as decreased SM, indicate the need of medical surveillance for treated patients.\",\n",
              " 'Bifidobacteria, which commonly inhabit the primate gut, are beneficial contributors to host wellbeing. Anatomical differences and natural habitat allow an arrangement of primates into two main parvorders; New World monkeys (NWM) and Old World monkeys (OWM). The number of newly described bifidobacterial species is clearly elevated in NWM. This corresponds to our finding that bifidobacteria were the dominant group of cultivated gut anaerobes in NWM, while their numbers halved in OWM and were often replaced by Clostridiaceae with sarcina morphology. We examined an extended MALDI-TOF MS database as a potential identification tool for rapid screening of bifidobacterial distribution in captive primates. Bifidobacterial isolates of NWM were assigned mainly to species of primate origin, while OWM possessed typically multi-host bifidobacteria. Moreover, bifidobacterial counts reflected the feed specialization of captive primates decreasing from frugivore-insectivores, gummivore-insectivores, frugivore-folivores to frugivore-omnivores. Amplicon sequencing analysis supported this trend with regards to the inverse ratio of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. In addition, a significantly higher diversity of the bacterial population in OWM was found. The evolution specialization of primates seems to be responsible for Bifidobacterium abundance and species occurrence. Balanced microbiota of captive primates could be supported by optimized prebiotic and probiotic stimulation based on the primate host.',\n",

It remains unclear whether blood flow in both CCA contributes equally to brain activity. Here, CCA blood flow was evaluated using ultrasonography in 23 patients with cerebrovascular diseases. Resting-state brain activity and cognitive status were also assessed using magnetoencephalography and a cognitive subscale of the Functional Independence Measure, respectively, to explore the relationships between blood flow, functional brain activity, and cognitive status. Our findings indicated that there was an association between blood flow and resting-state brain activity, and between resting-state brain activity and cognitive status. However, blood flow was not significantly associated with cognitive status directly. Furthermore, blood velocity in the right CCA correlated with resting-state brain activity, but not with the resistance index. In contrast, the resistance index in the left CCA correlated with resting-state brain activity, but not with blood velocity. Our findings suggest that hypoperfusion is important in the right CCA, whereas cerebral microcirculation is important in the left CCA for brain activity. Hence, this asymmetry should be considered when designing appropriate therapeutic strategies.',\n",

Recently, researchers have shown that hypergravity induces desired phenotypic variability in seedlings. In the present study, we tested the utility of hypergravity as a novel tool in inducing reliable phenotype/s for potential terrestrial crop improvement applications. To investigate, bread wheat seeds (UAS-375 genotype) were subjected to hypergravity treatment (10×g for 12, and 24\\xa0h), and evaluated for seedling vigor and plant growth parameters in both laboratory and greenhouse conditions. It was also attempted to elucidate the associated biochemical and hormonal changes at different stages of vegetative growth. Resultant data revealed that hypergravity treatment (10×g for 12\\xa0h) significantly enhanced root length, root volume, and root biomass in response to hypergravity. The robust seedling growth phenotype may be attributed to increased alpha-amylase and TDH enzyme activities observed in seeds treated with hypergravity. Elevated total chlorophyll content and Rubisco (55\\xa0kDa) protein expression across different stages of vegetative growth in response to hypergravity may impart physiological benefits to wheat growth. Further, hypergravity elicited robust endogenous phytohormones dynamics in root signifying altered phenotype/s.

HCC reflecting the activity of the HPA-axis 0-3 and 4-6\\xa0months prior to sampling was evaluated and compared between groups as well as between the two measurements of each study subject. In the univariate analysis with both cases and controls, an increase in HCC between the measurement timepoints was associated with a substantial increase in risk of appendicitis (OR 7.52 [95% CI 2.49-22.67], p = 0.001). This increased risk remained in the multivariate analysis after adjustment for age, sex and season (aOR OR 10.76 [95%CI 2.50-46.28], p  = 0.001). When comparing the cases of uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis through a multivariate analysis, adjusted for age and sex, the children with an increased HCC prior to appendicitis had a substantial and statistically significant increase in risk of complicated appendicitis (aOR 7.86 [95% CI 1.20-51.63], p = 0.03). Biological stress, measured as an increase in HCC, seems to be associated with an increased risk of paediatric appendicitis and a more complicated disease course.',\n",
              " 'While epigamic traits likely evolve via sexual selection, the mechanism whereby internal sexual dimorphism arises remains less well understood. Seeking clues as to how the internal sexual dimorphism evolved, we compared the abdominal musculature of 41 Drosophila montium group species, to determine whether any of these species carry a male-specific muscle of Lawrence (MOL). Our quantitative analysis revealed that the size of a sexually dimorphic MOL analog found in 19 montium group species varied widely from species to species, suggesting the gradual evolution of this sexually dimorphic neuromuscular trait. We attempted the ancestral state reconstitution for the presence or absence of the neuromuscular sexual dimorphism in the A5 segment; the neuromuscular sexual dimorphism existed in an old ancestor of the montium group, which was lost in some of the most recent common ancestors of derived lineages, and subsequently some species regained it. This loss-and-gain history was not shared by evolutionary changes in the courtship song pattern, even though both traits were commonly regulated by the master regulator male-determinant protein FruM. It is envisaged that different sets of FruM target genes may serve for shaping the song and MOL characteristics, respectively, and, as a consequence, each phenotypic trait underwent a distinct evolutionary path.',\n",

We used both psychological and physiological responses for evaluation. The former was based on NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX, NASA), and the latter was based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) P3b analysis of event-related potentials using the oddball paradigm experimental task. The results show that as illuminance increases, and the response time becomes longer with a colour temperature of 3000\\xa0K (P < 0.01). However, when the colour temperature is set at 6500\\xa0K, the response time becomes shorter as the illuminance increases (P < 0.01). P3b amplitudes were significantly affected by colour temperature (P = 0.009) and illuminance (P = 0.038) levels. The highest amplitudes occurred at 3000\\xa0K and 750\\xa0lx, which is consistent with the trend shown by the subjective scale. The data analysis of error rates is not significant. These results suggest that an office environment with a colour temperature of 3000\\xa0K and illumination of 750\\xa0lx, which exerts the lowest mental workload, is the most suitable for working. However, the interaction between colour temperature and illuminance in affecting the mental workload of participants is not clear. This work provides more appropriate lighting choices with colour temperature and illuminance to reduce people's mental workload in office settings.\",\n",
              " 'Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is an anticoagulant protein that inhibits factor VIIa and Xa in the coagulation cascade. It has been shown that forkhead box P3 protein is a TFPI transcriptional repressor. However, there are no studies on chromatin remodeling that control TFPI expression. We hypothesized that the genome-wide knockdowns of the chromatin binding and regulatory proteins (CBRPs) in zebrafish could identify novel tfpia gene regulators. As an initial step, we selected 69 CBRP genes from the list of zebrafish thrombocyte-expressed genes. We then performed a 3-gene piggyback knockdown screen of these 69 genes, followed by quantification of tfpia mRNA levels. The results revealed that knockdown of brd7, ing2, ing3, ing4, and suz12b increased tfpia mRNA levels. The simultaneous knockdown of these 5 genes also increased tfpia mRNA levels. We also performed individual gene and simultaneous 5-gene knockdowns on the 5 genes in zebrafish larvae. We found that after laser injury, it took a longer time for the formation of the thrombus to occlude the caudal vessel compared to the control larvae. We then treated the larvae and adults with a chemical UNC6852 known to proteolytically degrade polycomb repressor complex 2, where SUZ12 is a member, and observed prolongation of time to occlude (TTO)\\xa0the caudal vein after laser injury and increased tfpia mRNA levels in larvae and adults, respectively. In summary, our results have identified novel epigenetic regulators for tfpia and exploited this information to discover a drug that enhances tfpia mRNA levels and prolongation of TTO. This discovery provides the basis for testing whether UNC6852 could be used as an antithrombotic drug. This approach could be used to study the regulation of other plasma proteins, including coagulant and anticoagulant factors.',\n",

Multiparametric MRI was used to measure fibro-inflammation with corrected T1 (cT1), while the\\xa0biliary tree was modelled \\xa0 using quantitative MRCP (MRCP +). Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to compare liver function tests with imaging markers between patient groups (ASC vs AIH). Receiver operating characteristic curves and stepwise logistic regressions were used to identify the best combination of markers to discriminate between ASC and AIH. Correlations between liver function tests and imaging markers were performed using Spearman's rank correlation. cT1 was significantly correlated with liver function tests (range 0.33 = R = 56, p < 0.05), as well as with fibrosis, lobular and portal inflammation (range 0.31 = R = 42, p < 0.05). 19 MRCP + metrics correlated significantly with liver function tests (range 0.29 = R = 0.43, p < 0.05). GGT and MRCP + metrics were significantly higher in ASC compared to those with AIH. The best multivariable model for distinguishing ASC from AIH included total number of ducts and the sum of relative severity of both strictures and dilatations AUC: 0.91 (95% CI 0.78-1). Quantitative MRCP metrics are a good discriminator of ASC from AIH.\",\n",

Incidence of AD was defined by the first claim code for AD with anti-Alzheimer drugs. AD occurred in 9467 cases during a median 7.2\\xa0years of follow-up. Overall, statin use was not associated with an increased risk of AD incidence [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.99-1.10].

              " \"Heart failure (HF) and the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a direct association. Both can be cause and consequence of the other. Many factors are known, such as diabetes or hypertension, which can lead to the appearance and/or development of these two conditions. However, it is suspected that other factors, namely genetic ones, may explain the differences in the manifestation and progression of HF and CKD among patients. One candidate factor is Rph, a gene expressed in the nervous and excretory system in mammals and Drosophila, encoding a Rab small GTPase family effector protein implicated in vesicular trafficking. We found that Rph is expressed in the Drosophila heart, and the silencing of Rph gene expression in this organ had a strong impact in the organization of fibers and functional cardiac parameters. Specifically, we observed a significant increase in diastolic and systolic diameters of the heart tube, which is a phenotype that resembles dilated cardiomyopathy in humans. Importantly, we also show that silencing of Rabphilin (Rph) expression exclusively in the pericardial nephrocytes, which are part of the flies' excretory system, brings about a non-cell-autonomous effect on the Drosophila cardiac system. In summary, in this work, we demonstrate the importance of Rph in the fly cardiac system and how silencing Rph expression in nephrocytes affects the Drosophila cardiac system.\",\n",
              " 'The tumour microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in cancer development, progression, and metastasis. Various cytokines are present in the TME in oesophageal cancer. Oesophageal stricture is a major complication of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for oesophageal cancer, and inflammatory cytokines are closely related to its pathogenesis. However, the cytokine crosstalk involved in the oesophageal cancer TME and post-ESD stricture has not been fully elucidated. This study investigated the comprehensive cytokine dynamics following ESD in patients with oesophageal cancer. In addition, the effect of a novel preventive technique for post-ESD stricture, autologous cell sheet engraftment, on cytokine levels was evaluated. Various pro-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic cytokines were elevated in patients with oesophageal cancer, and ESD transiently influenced cytokine concentrations. IL-1ß and TNF-a, two major pro-inflammatory cytokines that induce oesophageal stricture, were significantly suppressed by cell sheet engraftment. In conclusion, this study revealed the distinct cytokine dynamics after ESD in patients with oesophageal cancer, together with the effect of autologous cell sheet engraftment on cytokine fluctuation. These results can accelerate research on the TME and therapeutic strategies for oesophageal cancer.',\n",

However, their respective effects on the recurrence, making allowance for the duration of recurrence and death without the occurrence of recurrence, and long-term survival have not been well elucidated. We aimed to evaluate long-term effect of two kinds of treatment on cerebrovascular death among ischemic stroke patients with or without the recurrence of stroke. Data used in this study were derived from the cohort based on a multicenter randomized double-blind controlled trial during 1992 to 1995 with the enrollment of a total of 466 patients with first-time non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke who were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (n = 222) or nicametate (n = 244). The trial cohort was followed up over time to ascertain the date of recurrence within trial period and death until Sep of 2019. The time-dependent Cox regression model was used to estimate the long-term effects of two treatments on death from cerebrovascular disease with and without recurrence. A total of 49 patients experienced stroke recurrence and 89 cerebrovascular deaths was confirmed. Patients treated with nicametate were more likely, but non statistically significantly, to have recurrence (aHR: 1.73, 95% CI 0.96-3.13) as compared with those treated by aspirin. Nicametate reduced the risk of cerebrovascular death about 37% (aHR: 0.63, 95% CI 0.41-0.97) compared with aspirin. The aspirin group had a lower recurrence rate than the nicametate group even with recurrence after 1-2\\xa0years of follow-up of first stroke but the latter had significantly reduced death from cerebrovascular disease for nicametate group, which requires more research to verify.',\n",

Our objective was to evaluate MVR in children below 5\\xa0years and identify factors affecting the outcomes. This retrospective study included 29 patients who had MVR from 2002 to 2020. We grouped the patients into two groups according to their age: age = 24\\xa0months (n = 18) and > 24\\xa0months (n = 11). Primary cardiac diagnoses were Shone complex (n = 7; 24%), isolated congenital mitral valve abnormality (n = 11; 38%), and complete atrioventricular septal defect (n = 3; 10%). The median age was 19\\xa0month (25th-75th percentile: 11-32) and 59% were females (n = 17). The hemodynamic lesions were mitral regurgitation in 66%, mitral stenosis in 10%, and combined mitral stenosis and regurgitation in 24% of the patients. St. Jude mitral valve was the most common valve implanted (n = 19, 66%), followed by CarboMedics in 21% of the patients (n = 6). The mitral valve was implanted in the supra-annular position in 6 cases (21%). Preoperative and operative data were comparable between both groups. There was no association between valve size and position with postoperative heart block (P > 0.99, for both). The median follow-up duration was 19.4\\xa0months (8.6-102.5). Nine patients had mitral valve reoperation, six had MVR, and three had clot removal from the mitral valve. There was no effect for age group on reoperation (SHR 0.89 (95% CI 0.27-2.87), P = 0.84). Valve size significantly affected reoperation (SHR 0.39 (95% CI 0.18-0.87), P = 0.02). The supra-annular position was associated with an increased risk of reoperation (SHR 3.1 (95% CI 1.003-9.4), P = 0.049). There was no difference in survival according to the age (Log-rank P = 0.57) or valve size (Log-rank P = 0.66). Mitral valve replacement in children is associated with low morbidity and mortality. The risk of reoperation could be affected by the valve size and position rather than the age.',\n",

Understanding gene-phenotype associations is vital to unravel the disease mechanisms and advance its diagnosis and treatment. To date, several databases have stored a large portion of gene-phenotype associations which are mainly obtained from genetic experiments. However, a large proportion of gene-phenotype associations are still buried in the autism-related literature and there are limited resources to investigate autism-associated gene-phenotype associations. Given the abundance of the autism-related literature, we were thus motivated to develop Autism_genepheno, a text mining pipeline to identify sentence-level mentions of autism-associated genes and phenotypes in literature through natural language processing methods. We have generated a comprehensive database of gene-phenotype associations in the last five years' autism-related literature that can be easily updated as new literature becomes available. We have evaluated our pipeline through several different approaches, and we are able to rank and select top autism-associated genes through their unique and wide spectrum of phenotypic profiles, which could provide a unique resource for the diagnosis and treatment of autism.

In the presence of 5\\xa0ng/mL TGFß2, the effects of these inhibitors were characterized by transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), FITC-dextran permeability, and the size and stiffness of 3D sphenoids, the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) including collagen1, 4 and 6, and fibronectin, a-smooth muscle actin, a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)1-4, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2, 9 and 14. TGFß2 caused a significant increase in the TEER values, and decrease in FITC-dextran permeability, as well as a decrease in the sizes and stiffness of the 3D sphenoids. In the presence of ROCK inhibitors, the TGFß2-induced effects of the TEER and FITC-dextran permeability were inhibited, especially by KD025. Rip induced a significant increase in sizes and a decrease in the stiffness of the TGFß2-treated 3D sphenoids, although the effects of KD025 were weaker. Gene expressions of most of the ECMs, TIMP2 and MMP9 of 2D and 3D HTM cells were significantly up-regulated by TGFß2. Those were significantly and differently modulated by Rip or KD025.',\n",

When kidneys are exposed to severe injury, tubular cell death occurs and kidney fibrosis progresses by activating fibroblasts and myofibroblasts (referred to as (myo)fibroblasts), leading to CKD; however, the pathological and molecular mechanisms underlying CKD, including kidney fibrosis, remain obscure. In the present study, we focused on a transcription factor PBX/Knotted Homeobox 2 (PKNOX2) in kidney fibrosis. The transcript and protein expression of PKNOX2 was upregulated in fibrotic kidneys after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Importantly, immunofluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that the number of PKNOX2-expressing myofibroblasts was increased, whereas the expression of PKNOX2 was decreased in proximal tubular epithelial cells after UUO. In (myo)fibroblasts, PKNOX2 was induced by TGF-ß1. Knockdown of PKNOX2 using shRNA lentiviral system reduced the viability of (myo)fibroblasts either in the presence or absence of TGF-ß1, accompanied by increased apoptosis. Moreover, PKNOX2 knockdown decreased TGF-ß1-induced migration of myofibroblasts and differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Significantly, knockdown of PKNOX2 also decreased the viability and increased apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells. Collectively, PKNOX2 regulates the function of (myo)fibroblasts and the viability of proximal tubular epithelial cells in progression of kidney fibrosis.',\n",

Although PICALM is known to regulate initiation of autophagy, its role in maturation of lysosomal enzymes required for proteolysis has not been studied. We sought to determine the importance of PICALM for cellular degradative function by disrupting exon 1 of PICALM using CRISPR/Cas9 in HeLa cells. PICALM disruption increased numbers of early endosomes. Proteomic analysis of endosome-enriched samples showed that disrupting exon 1 of PICALM increased the abundance of lysosomal enzymes in these organelles, and western blotting revealed disruption to processing and maturation of the lysosomal protease, cathepsin D, and a deficit in autophagy. This study shows PICALM is important for the correct maturation of lysosomal enzymes and efficient proteolytic function in the lysosome.\",\n",

The wet-cyclone air sampler sucks the air and concentrates the bioaerosols into 10\\xa0mL of aqueous solvent. After 5\\xa0min of air sampling, the bioaerosol-containing solution was conveyed to the microfluidic cytometer for detection. The device was tested with aerosolized microbeads, dust, and Escherichia coli (E. coli). CCAM is shown to differentiate particles from 0.96 to 2.95\\xa0µm with high accuracy. The wet cyclone air-sampler showed a 28.04% sampling efficiency, and the DC impedance cytometer showed 87.68% detection efficiency, giving a total of 24.59% overall CCAM efficiency.

This cross-sectional study included 263 MS patients who were classified according to the presence (M+, n=72) and absence (M-, n=191) of LS-OCMB. CSF cellular subsets and molecules implicated in immunosenescence were explored. In M- patients, aging induced remarkable decreases in absolute CSF counts of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, including Th1 and Th17 cells, and of B cells, including those secreting TNF-alpha. It also increased serum anti-CMV IgG antibody titers (indicative of immunosenescence) and CSF CHI3L1 levels (related to astrocyte activation). In contrast, M+ patients showed an age-associated increase of TIM-3 (a biomarker of T cell exhaustion) and increased values of CHI3L1, independently of age. Finally, in both groups, age induced an increase in CSF levels of PD-L1 (an inductor of T cell tolerance) and activin A (part of the senescence-associated secretome and related to inflammaging). These changes were independent of the disease duration. Finally, this resulted in augmented disability. In summary, all MS patients experience with age a modest induction of T-cell tolerance and an activation of the innate immunity, resulting in increased disability. Additionally, M- patients show clear decreases in CSF lymphocyte numbers, which could increase the risk of infections. Thus, age and immunological status are important for tailoring effective therapies in MS.',\n",
              " 'Coronavirus 19 Disease (COVID-19) originating in the province of Wuhan, China in 2019, is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), whose infection in humans causes mild or severe clinical manifestations that mainly affect the respiratory system. So far, the COVID-19 has caused more than 2 million deaths worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 contains the Spike (S) glycoprotein on its surface, which is the main target for current vaccine development because antibodies directed against this protein can neutralize the infection. Companies and academic institutions have developed vaccines based on the S glycoprotein, as well as its antigenic domains and epitopes, which have been proven effective in generating neutralizing antibodies. However, the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants could affect the effectiveness of vaccines. Here, we review the different types of vaccines designed and developed against SARS-CoV-2, placing emphasis on whether they are based on the complete S glycoprotein, its antigenic domains such as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or short epitopes within the S glycoprotein. We also review and discuss the possible effectiveness of these vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.',\n",
              " 'Unprecedented and unforeseen highly infectious Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a significant public health concern for most of the countries worldwide, including Nepal, and it is spreading rapidly. Undoubtedly, every nation has taken maximum initiative measures to break the transmission chain of the virus. This review presents a retrospective analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal, analyzing the actions taken by the Government of Nepal (GoN) to inform future decisions. Data used in this article were extracted from relevant reports and websites of the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) of Nepal and the WHO. As of January 22, 2021, the highest numbers of cases were reported in the megacity of the hilly region, Kathmandu district (population = 1,744,240), and Bagmati province. The cured and death rates of the disease among the tested population are ~98.00 and ~0.74%, respectively. Higher numbers of infected cases were observed in the age group 21-30, with an overall male to female death ratio of 2.33. With suggestions and recommendations from high-level coordination committees and experts, GoN has enacted several measures: promoting universal personal protection, physical distancing, localized lockdowns, travel restrictions, isolation, and selective quarantine. In addition, GoN formulated and distributed several guidelines/protocols for managing COVID-19 patients and vaccination programs. Despite robust preventive efforts by GoN, pandemic scenario in Nepal is, yet, to be controlled completely. This review could be helpful for the current and future effective outbreak preparedness, responses, and management of the pandemic situations and prepare necessary strategies, especially in countries with similar socio-cultural and economic status.',\n",
              " 'Undoubtedly, the COVID-19 pandemic is not the first and most frightening global pandemic, and it may not be the last. At the very least, this phenomenon has though seriously challenged the health systems of the world; it has created a new perspective on the value of national, regional, and international cooperation during crises. The post-coronavirus world could be a world of intensified nationalist rivalries on the economic revival and political influence. However, strengthening cooperation among nations at different levels will lead to the growth of health, economy, and security. The current situation is a touchstone for international actors in coordinating the efforts in similar future crises. At present, this pandemic crisis cannot be resolved except through joint international cooperation, global cohesion, and multilateralism. This perspective concludes that the pandemic could be an excellent opportunity for the scope of global health diplomacy (GHD) and how it can be applied and practiced for strengthening five global arenas, namely (1) International Cooperation and Global Solidarity, (2) Global Economy, Trade and Development, (3) Global Health Security, (4) Strengthening health systems, and (5) Addressing inequities to achieve the global health targets. GHD proves to be very useful for negotiating better policies, stronger partnerships, and achieving international cooperation in this phase with many geopolitical shifts and nationalist mindset among many nations at this stage of COVID-19 vaccine roll-out.',\n",
              " \"The continuous and protracted conflict in Yemen has evolved into the worst humanitarian situation in modern history. All public structures in the country, including the health system and its basic functions, have been under tremendous pressures. One of the key obstacles to improve the health outcomes in Yemen is fragmentation of the health system. This study aims at exploring and documenting the forms of health system fragmentation in humanitarian and conflict-affected contexts by studying Yemen as a case study. We collected national qualitative data from key informants through in-depth interviews. A pool of respondents was identified from the Ministry of Public Health and Population, donors, and non-governmental organizations. Data were collected between May and June 2019. We interviewed eight key informants and reviewed national health policy documents, and references provided by key informants. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. We further conducted a literature review to augment and triangulate the findings. Six themes emerged from our datasets and analyses, representing various forms of fragmentation: political, structural, inter-sectoral, financial, governance, and health agenda-related forms. Health system fragmentation in Yemen existed before the conflict eruption and has aggravated as the conflict evolves. The humanitarian situation and the collapsing health system enabled the influx of various national and international health actors. In conclusion, the protracted conflict and fragile situation in Yemen have accentuated the fragmentation of the health system. Addressing these fragmentations' forms by all health actors and building consensus on health system agenda are recommended. Health system analysis and in-depth study of fragmentation drivers in Yemen can be beneficial to build common ground and priorities to reduce health system fragmentation. Furthermore, capacity building of a health system is fundamental for the humanitarian development nexus, health system integration, and recovery efforts in the future.\",\n",
              " 'The COVID-19 pandemic exposed and exacerbated longstanding inefficiencies and deficiencies in chronic disease management and treatment in the United States, such as a fragmented healthcare experience and system, narrowly focused services, limited resources beyond office visits, expensive yet low quality care, and poor access to comprehensive prevention and non-pharmacological resources. It is feared that the addition of COVID-19 survivors to the pool of chronic disease patients will burden an already precarious healthcare system struggling to meet the needs of chronic disease patients. Digital health and telemedicine solutions, which exploded during the pandemic, may address many inefficiencies and deficiencies in chronic disease management, such as increasing access to care. However, these solutions are not panaceas as they are replete with several limitations, such as low uptake, poor engagement, and low long-term use. To fully optimize digital health and telemedicine solutions, we argue for the gamification of digital health and telemedicine solutions through a pantheoretical framework-one that uses personalized, contextualized, and behavioral science algorithms, data, evidence, and theories to ground treatments.',\n",

              " 'Screening of high-risk groups for Tuberculosis (TB) is considered as the cornerstone for TB elimination but the measure of cost-effectiveness is also crucial in deciding the strategy for TB screening. This study aims to measure the cost-effectiveness of TB screening between the various high-risk groups in Malaysia. A decision tree model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of TB screening among the high-risk groups from a provider perspective using secondary data from the year 2016 to 2018. The results are presented in terms of an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), expressed as cost per TB case detected. Deterministic and Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis was also performed to measure the robustness of the model. TB screening among Person Living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PL HIV) was the most cost-effective strategy, with MYR 2,597.00 per TB case detected. This was followed by elderly, prisoners and smokers with MYR 2,868.62, MYR 3,065.24, and MYR 4,327.76 per one TB case detected, respectively. There was an incremental cost of MYR 2.49 per screening, and 3.4 TB case detection per 1,000 screening for TB screening among PL HIV in relation to TB screening among prisoners. The probability of symptomatic cases diagnosed as TB was the key driver for increasing cost-effectiveness efficacy among PL HIV. Results of the study suggest prioritization of high-risk group TB screening program by focusing on the most cost-effective strategy such as screening among PL HIV, prisoners and elderly, which has a lower cost per TB case detected.',\n",

Most diagnostic laboratories use PCR as quick easy tool for C.\\xa0fetus identification. However, there is no standardized PCR assay for C.\\xa0fetus detection and subspecies differentiation, hindering the comparison of results. In this study, we evaluated selected PCR assays targeting the 16S rRNA, gyrB, cpn60, cstA, cdtB and nahE genes for C.\\xa0fetus identification and ISCfe1, sapB2, parA and virB11 for subspecies differentiation. Analytical sensitivity and specificity were assessed for each PCR assay, and the assays were then tested on 289 bull preputial samples that had also been analysed by 16S rRNA barcode metagenomics. In total, 41 C.\\xa0fetus-positive samples were included. The P12 PCR assay targeting the gyrB gene performed best, detecting the pathogen in 95.1% of positive samples. For the discrimination of C.\\xa0fetus subspecies, we were able to identify a proportion (85.4%) of the C.\\xa0fetus-positive samples correctly as C.\\xa0fetus venerealis with at least one subspecies-specific PCR, but C.\\xa0fetus fetus was not detected in any of the samples tested. Remarkably, C.\\xa0fetus subspecies amplification was observed following PCR on some samples (33.1%) considered C.\\xa0fetus-negative, highlighting the need for rigorous criteria for discriminating between C.\\xa0fetus subspecies, to improve understanding of the role of the two C.\\xa0fetus subspecies in the epidemiology and pathogenesis of bovine infectious infertility.',\n",
              " 'Two studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of trace mineral supplementation on traditional and novel measures of bull fertility. In Experiment 1, 37 mature bulls received one of three dietary supplements daily for 71\\xa0d: 1) Supplement without Cu, Zn, and Mn (CON); 2) Supplement with Cu, Zn, and Mn sulfate (SULF); and 3) Supplement with basic Cu chloride, and Zn and Mn hydroxychloride (CHLR). In Experiment 2, 128 Angus or Angus-Hereford bull calves were maintained on a growing diet for 75\\xa0d (year 1) or 119\\xa0d (year 2) in Calan gate equipped pens without mineral supplementation. Bulls (n\\xa0=\\xa032 head/treatment) received one of four trace mineral supplements daily for 84\\xa0d: 1) Zn with no Cu (ZN), 2) Cu with no Zn (CU), 3) Cu and Zn (ZNCU), or 4) no Cu or Zn (CON). Bull fertility measures included a breeding soundness evaluation (BSE) and novel fertility measures conducted using flow cytometry. In mature bulls, final liver Zn concentration was positively correlated (P\\xa0=\\xa00.02) with sperm concentration (r\\xa0=\\xa00.31) and tended (P\\xa0=\\xa00.06) to be negatively correlated with acrosome damage (r\\xa0=\\xa0-0.39). Peripubertal bulls receiving ZNCU had greater ADG than bulls in the CU group (P\\xa0=\\xa00.05). Each BSE and novel fertility component improved from Day 0-84 in peripubertal bulls and were not affected (P\\xa0>\\xa00.10) by mineral supplementation. Bulls that received no supplement (CON) had greater (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01) percentage of sperm with distal midpiece reflex (6.9 vs 4.0% for CON and TM supplement, respectively) and Dag or Dag-like defect (2.6 vs 1.4% for CON and TM supplement, respectively) in their ejaculates. Sperm viability after 30\\xa0min of incubation were not affected by trace mineral supplementation, but after 3\\xa0h incubation, sperm viability tended to differ (P\\xa0=\\xa00.06) between treatments and tended to be less for CON bulls (48.5%) compared to ZNCU bulls (55.1%). Among contrast comparisons, trace mineral supplemented bulls had greater (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) percentage of viable sperm at 3\\xa0h post collection and reactive oxygen resistant sperm than CON bulls. Addition of Zn to trace mineral containing Cu (ZNCU) improved (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) percentage of sperm in the ejaculate with high mitochondrial energy potential and viable sperm with intact acrosome membrane. In summary, it appears the homeostasis mechanisms for bull trace mineral maintenance are extremely efficient and mineral supplementation of mature and peripubertal bulls did not have major improvements in any laboratory or chute-side measures of bull fertility, however bulls exposed to breeding or in environments with diet antagonists might respond differently.',\n",
              " \"Invasive species are one of the main biodiversity loss drivers. Some species can establish and thrive in novel habitats, impacting local communities, as is the case of managed pollinators. In this regard, an invasive species' expansion process over time is critical for its control and management. A good example is the European bumblebee Bombus terrestris, which has rapidly invaded the southern part of South America after being repeatedly introduced in Chile for crop pollination since 1997. We assessed the temporal dynamics of B. terrestris invasion in Argentina and Chile by compiling 562 occurrence points from 2000 to 2019. We used two estimators (minimum convex polygon and 95% fixed kernel) to estimate the increase of the invaded area over time. We found that the area invaded by B. terrestris in the southern part of South America presents a linear increase over time, which was consistent for both estimators. In this scenario, species traits, environmental characteristics, and introduction dynamics facilitate a rapid invasion process that will continue to expand, reaching other South American countries in the near future. As this bumblebee is a super-generalist, it probably will expand across South America, as climate niche modelling predicts, if no actions were taken.\",\n",
              " 'From early infancy, human face-to-face communication is multimodal, comprising a plethora of interlinked communicative and sensory modalities. Although there is also growing evidence for this in nonhuman primates, previous research rarely disentangled production from perception of signals. Consequently, the functions of integrating articulators (i.e. production organs involved in multicomponent acts) and sensory channels (i.e. modalities involved in multisensory acts) remain poorly understood. Here, we studied close-range social interactions within and beyond mother-infant pairs of Bornean and Sumatran orang-utans living in wild and captive settings, to examine use of and responses to multicomponent and multisensory communication. From the perspective of production, results showed that multicomponent acts were used more than the respective unicomponent acts when the presumed goal did not match the dominant outcome for a specific communicative act, and were more common among non-mother-infant dyads and Sumatran orang-utans. From the perception perspective, we found that multisensory acts were more effective than the respective unisensory acts, and were used more in wild compared to captive populations. We argue that multisensory acts primarily facilitate effectiveness, whereas multicomponent acts become relevant when interaction outcomes are less predictable. These different functions underscore the importance of distinguishing between production and perception in studies of communication.',\n",

Minority insect-associated species was reported. Simplicillium coccinellidae, S. hymenopterorum, S. neolepidopterorum and S. scarabaeoidea were introduced as the newly insect-associated species. The phylogenetic analyses of two combined datasets (LSU + RPB1 + TEF and SSU + ITS + LSU) revealed that S. coccinellidae and S. hymenopterorum were both nested in an independent clade. S. neolepidopterorum and S. scarabaeoidea have a close relationship with S. formicidae and S. lepidopterorum, respectively. S. neolepidopterorum can be easily distinguished from S. formicidae by ellipsoidal to cylindrical, solitary conidia which occasionally gather in short imbricate chains. S. scarabaeoidea could be easily distinguished from S. lepodopterorum by having longer phialides and larger conidia. Based on the morphological and phylogenetic conclusion, we determine the four newly generated isolates as new species of Simplicillium and a new combination is proposed in the genus Leptobacillium.',\n",
              " 'Apolipoprotein L1 (ApoL1) is a circulating innate immunity protein protecting against trypanosome infection. However, two ApoL1 coding variants are associated with a highly increased risk of chronic kidney disease. Here we present X-ray and NMR structures of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of ApoL1 and of its closest relative ApoL2. In both proteins, four of the five NTD helices form a four-helix core structure which is different from the classical four-helix bundle and from the pore-forming domain of colicin A. The reactivity with a conformation-specific antibody and structural models predict that this four-helix motif is also present in the NTDs of ApoL3 and ApoL4, suggesting related functions within the small ApoL family. The long helix 5 of ApoL1 is conformationally flexible and contains the BH3-like region. This BH3-like a-helix\\xa0resembles true BH3 domains only in sequence and structure but not in function, since it does not bind to the pro-survival members of the Bcl-2 family, suggesting a Bcl-2-independent role in cytotoxicity. These findings should expedite a more comprehensive structural and functional understanding of the ApoL immune protein family.',\n",

We calculated univariable and multivariable (adjusted) (1) proportional hazards (Fine and Gray) survival regression models and (2) logistic regression models for in-hospital mortality and admission to ICU, to evaluate the most common comorbidities as potential risk factors.,We found that old age was the strongest factor for in-hospital mortality after having adjusted for gender and the considered comorbidities (hazard ratio [HR] 2.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.33&minus;2.59 and HR 5.6 95% CI 5.23&minus;6 for ages 65 and 80 years, respectively). In addition, male gender remained an important risk factor in the multivariable models (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.41&minus;1.53). Of all comorbidities, renal disease, oncological pathologies, chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease (but not hypertension) and dementia were also risk factors for in-hospital mortality. With respect to ICU admission risk, the pattern was different, as patients with higher chances of survival might have been admitted more often to ICU. Male gender (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.58&minus;2.31), hypertension (OR&nbsp; 1.3, 95% CI 1.07&minus;1.59) and age 55&ndash;79 years (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06&minus;1.26) are risk factors for ICU admission. Patients aged 80+ years, as well as patients with dementia or with liver disease were admitted less often to ICU.,We conclude that increasing age is the most important risk factor for in-hospital mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in Switzerland, along with male gender and followed by the presence of comorbidities such as renal diseases, chronic respiratory or cardiovascular disease, oncological malignancies and dementia. Male gender, hypertension and age between 55 and 79 years are, however, risk factors for ICU admission. Mortality and ICU admission need to be considered as separate outcomes when investigating risk factors for pandemic control measures and for hospital resources planning.',\n",

Here, we present a novel approach for whole-substance bioconcentration testing applied to cedarwood oil-an essential oil composed of volatile, hydrophobic organic chemicals. The method yields whole-body elimination rate constants for a mixture of constituents. Our approach combines in vivo dietary fish exposure with internal benchmarking and headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) equilibrium sampling followed by suspect-screening analysis. We quantified depuration rate constants of 13 individual cedarwood oil constituents based on relative peak areas using gas chromatography (GC) coupled with Orbitrap-mass spectrometry (MS) and GC triple-quadrupole (QqQ)-MS. For seven constituents with available analytical standards, we compared the rate constants to the results obtained from solvent extraction, clean-up, and targeted GC-MS analysis. The HS-SPME sampling approach allowed for automated sample extraction and analyte enrichment while minimizing evaporative losses of the volatile target analytes and reducing matrix interferences from low-volatility organics. The suspect-screening analysis enabled the quantification of constituents without available analytical standards, while the internal benchmarking significantly reduced variability from differences in delivered dose and analytical variability between the samples.',\n",

Methods We identified all cDLBCL cases in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry from 1975 to 2016. We compared survival (overall and lymphoma-specific) of patients diagnosed prior to versus after rituximab approval in 2006. Results A total of 106 patients were included in the final analysis. Median age was 69.5\\xa0years, 67% of the patients were white and 64% had local stage I/II disease. 67% of the patients were diagnosed after 2006 and thus belonged to the rituximab era group. Overall, 77% received chemotherapy, 24% had surgery and 15% had radiotherapy. Median overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort was 22\\xa0months. Median OS was 16\\xa0months (95% CI, 0.55-31) for the pre-rituximab group, versus 26\\xa0months (95% CI, 7.5-45) for the rituximab group (p\\xa0=\\xa00.34). Median lymphoma-specific survival (LSS) was 30\\xa0months (95% CI, 8.0-52) for the pre-rituximab group versus 36\\xa0months (95% CI, 16-158) for the rituximab group (p\\xa0=\\xa00.30). OS and LSS were also not significantly different between the two era groups when stratified by chemotherapy. In multivariable analysis, both OS and LSS were associated with lymphoma stage, insurance status and age but not with diagnosis era or chemotherapy.

Deconvoluted peak areas of deuterated samples from the ssHDX-MS study showed a good correlation with the loss of the monomeric peak area measured by size exclusion chromatography in the 90-day accelerated stability study conducted at 40\\xa0°C. Low-temperature (70\\xa0°C inlet temperature) drying with an electrostatic charge (5\\xa0kV) led to better protein physical stability as compared with the samples spray-dried at the high temperature (130\\xa0°C inlet temperature) without charge. This study shows that electrostatic spray drying can produce solid monoclonal antibody formulation at lower inlet temperature than traditional spray drying with better physical stability.',\n",
              " 'Diazepam is commonly used in the management of epileptic seizures, although it has limitations that can be overcome by using formulations that are easier to administer and capable of directing the drug to the brain. In this field, it has been reported that the use of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) via intranasal (or via nose-to-brain) promotes the targeting of drugs to the brain, improving the effectiveness of therapy. The aim of this work was to optimize two diazepam-loaded NLC formulations for nose-to-brain delivery, one with positive surface charge and one with negative surface charge. The quality by design (QbD) approach was used to design the experiments, where the quality target product profile (QTPP), the risk assessment and the critical quality attributes (CQAs) were defined to ensure safety, efficacy and quality of the final formulations. The experiments started with the optimization of critical material attributes (CMAs), related to the ratios of lipids and emulsifiers, followed by the selection of critical process parameters (CPPs), related to the production methods of the diazepam-loaded NLC formulation (ultrasound technique and high-pressure homogenization - HPH). Afterwards, the positive surface charge of the diazepam-loaded NLC was optimized. Finally, the biocompatibility with human neuronal cells of the formulation with a negative surface charge and of the formulation with a positive surface charge was evaluated. The results of the optimization of the CMAs showed that the ratios of lipids and emulsifiers more adequate were 6.7:2.9 and 4.2:0.3 (% w,w), respectively. Regarding the CPPs, HPH was considered the most suitable production method, resulting in an optimized diazepam-loaded NLC formulation (F1C15) with negative surface charge, showing particle size of 69.59\\xa0±\\xa00.22\\xa0nm, polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.19\\xa0±\\xa00.00, zeta potential (ZP) of -23.50\\xa0±\\xa00.24\\xa0mV and encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 96.60\\xa0±\\xa00.03 %. The optimized diazepam-loaded NLC formulation (F2A8) with positive surface charge had particle size of 124.40\\xa0±\\xa00.84\\xa0nm, PDI of 0.17\\xa0±\\xa00.01, ZP of 32.60\\xa0±\\xa01.13\\xa0mV and EE of 95.76\\xa0±\\xa00.24 %. In addition, the incorporation of diazepam in NLC resulted in a sustained release of the drug. No significant changes in particle size, PDI, ZP and EE were observed for the formulation F1C15, after 3\\xa0months of storage, whereas for formulation F2A8, particle size increased significantly. Biocompatibility studies showed that the formulation F2A8 was more cytotoxic than the formulation F1C15. Thereby, we conclude that the formulation F1C15 is more suitable for targeting the brain, when compared with the formulation F2A8. From the results of these studies, it can be confirmed that the QbD approach is an adequate and central tool to optimize NLC formulations.',\n",
              " 'Research in the development of ophthalmic drug formulations and innovative technologies over the past few decades has been directed at improving the penetration of medications delivered to the eye. Currently, approximately 90% of all ophthalmic drug formulations (e.g. liposomes, micelles) are applied as eye drops. The major challenge of topical eye drops is low bioavailability, need for frequent instillation due to the short half-life, poor drug solubility, and potential side effects. Recent research has been focused on improving topical drug delivery devices by increasing ocular residence time, overcoming physiological and anatomical barriers, and developing medical devices and drug formulations to increase the duration of action of the active drugs. Researchers have developed innovative technologies and formulations ranging from sub-micron to macroscopic size such as prodrugs, enhancers, mucus-penetrating particles (MPPs), therapeutic contact lenses, and collagen corneal shields. Another approach towards the development of effective topical drug delivery is embedding therapeutic formulations in microdevices designed for sustained release of the active drugs. The goal is to optimize the delivery of ophthalmic medications by achieving high drug concentration with prolonged duration of action that is convenient for patients to administer.',\n",

Patient demographics, preoperative assessments, surgical procedures, and outcomes were reviewed.,Patients 1 and 3 had a reliable eABR throughout tumor removal. Patient 2 had eABR pretumor removal, but post-tumor removal eABR presence could not be reliably determined because of electrical artifact interference. All patients achieved auditory percepts upon CI activation. Patients 1 and 2 experienced a decline in CI performance after 1 yr and after 3 mo, respectively. Patient 3 continues to perform well at 9 mo. Patients 2 and 3 are daily users of their CI.,Cochlear implantation is attainable in cases of NF2-associated VS resection. Intraoperative eABR may facilitate cochlear nerve preservation during tumor removal, though more data and long-term outcomes are needed to refine eABR methodology and predictive value for this population.',\n",
              " 'Human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection activates a complex interaction host/virus, leading to the reprogramming of the host metabolism aimed at the energy supply for viral replication. Alterations of the host metabolic homeostasis strongly influence the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, forming the basis of a wide range of outcomes, from the asymptomatic infection to the onset of COVID-19 and up to\\xa0life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome, vascular dysfunction, multiple organ failure, and death. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms associated with the individual susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection calls for a system biology approach; this strategy can address multiple goals, including which patients will respond effectively to the therapeutic treatment. The power of metabolomics lies\\xa0in the ability to recognize endogenous and exogenous metabolites within a biological sample, measuring their concentration, and identifying perturbations of biochemical pathways associated with qualitative and quantitative metabolic changes. Over the last year, a limited number of metabolomics- and lipidomics-based clinical studies in COVID-19 patients have been published and are discussed in this review. Remarkable alterations in the lipid and amino acid metabolism depict the molecular phenotype of\\xa0subjects infected by SARS-CoV-2; notably, structural and functional\\xa0data on the lipids-virus interaction may open new perspectives on targeted therapeutic interventions. Several limitations affect most metabolomics-based studies, slowing the routine application of metabolomics. However, moving metabolomics from bench to bedside cannot imply the mere determination of a given metabolite panel; rather, slotting metabolomics into clinical practice requires the conversion of metabolic patient-specific data into actionable clinical applications.',\n",

Thanks to advances in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) guidelines and teaching skills, results in children have improved. However, pediatric CA has a very high mortality. In the treatment of in-hospital CA there are still multiple controversies. The objective of this study is to develop a multicenter and international registry of in-hospital pediatric cardiac arrest including the diversity of management in different clinical and social contexts. Participation in this register will enable the evaluation of the diagnosis of CA, CPR and post-resuscitation care and its influence in survival and neurological prognosis.,An intrahospital CA data recording protocol has been designed following the Utstein model.

Invitation to participate has been sent to Spanish, European and Latinamerican hospitals. Variables included, asses hospital characteristics, the resuscitation team, patient's demographics and background, CPR, post-resuscitation care, mortality, survival and long-term evolution. Survival at hospital discharge will be evaluated as a primary outcome and survival with good neurological status as a secondary outcome, analyzing the different factors involved in them. The study design is prospective, observational registry of a cohort of pediatric CA.,This study represents the development of a registry of in-hospital CA in childhood. Its development will provide access to CPR data in different hospital settings and will allow the analysis of current controversies in the treatment of pediatric CA and post-resuscitation care.

Natural language processing (NLP) describes a set of techniques used to convert passages of written text into interpretable datasets that can be analysed by statistical and machine learning (ML) models. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to contemporary techniques for the analysis of text-data, using freely-available software.,We performed three NLP experiments using publicly-available data obtained from medicine review websites. First, we conducted lexicon-based sentiment analysis on open-text patient reviews of four drugs: Levothyroxine, Viagra, Oseltamivir and Apixaban. Next, we used unsupervised ML (latent Dirichlet allocation, LDA) to identify similar drugs in the dataset, based solely on their reviews. Finally, we developed three supervised ML algorithms to predict whether a drug review was associated with a positive or negative rating. These algorithms were: a regularised logistic regression, a support vector machine (SVM), and an artificial neural network (ANN). We compared the performance of these algorithms in terms of classification accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity.,Levothyroxine and Viagra were reviewed with a higher proportion of positive sentiments than Oseltamivir and Apixaban. One of the three LDA clusters clearly represented drugs used to treat mental health problems. A common theme suggested by this cluster was drugs taking weeks or months to work. Another cluster clearly represented drugs used as contraceptives. Supervised machine learning algorithms predicted positive or negative drug ratings with classification accuracies ranging from 0.664, 95% CI [0.608, 0.716] for the regularised regression to 0.720, 95% CI [0.664,0.776] for the SVM.,In this paper, we present a conceptual overview of common techniques used to analyse large volumes of text, and provide reproducible code that can be readily applied to other research studies using open-source software.',\n",

We compared patients' clinical characteristics and outcomes between the hemorrhagic pneumonia group and non-hemorrhagic pneumonia group.,Twenty-seven (49.1%) patients developed hemorrhagic pneumonia. The overall mortality rate of SM bacteremia was 67.3%. Hemorrhagic pneumonia (adjusted HR 2.316, 95% CI 1.140-4.705; P = 0.020) was an independent risk factor of 30-day mortality in hematological patients with SM bacteremia. Compared with the non-hemorrhagic pneumonia group, patients in the hemorrhagic pneumonia group were older and showed clinical manifestations as higher proportions of isolated SM in sputum culture, neutropenia and elevated procalcitonin (PCT). Multivariate analysis showed that neutropenia, high levels of PCT, prior tigecycline therapy within 1 month were independent risk factors associated with hemorrhagic pneumonia.,Neutropenia, high level of PCT and prior tigecycline therapy within 1 month were significant independent predictors of hemorrhagic pneumonia in hematologic patients with SM bacteremia. Due to no effective antibiotics to prevent hemorrhagic pneumonia, prophylaxis of SM infection and its progression to hemorrhagic pneumonia is particularly important.\",\n",

Obtaining a robust method for plasmid classification is necessary to better understand the genetics and epidemiology of many pathogens. Until now, plasmid classification systems focused on specific traits, which limited their precision and universality. The definition of plasmid taxonomic units (PTUs), based on average nucleotide identity metrics, allows the generation of a universal plasmid classification scheme, applicable to all bacterial taxa. Here we present COPLA, a software able to assign plasmids to known and novel PTUs, based on their genomic sequence.,We implemented an automated pipeline able to assign a given plasmid DNA sequence to its cognate PTU, and assessed its performance using a sample of 1000 unclassified plasmids. Overall, 41% of the samples could be assigned to a previously defined PTU, a number that reached 63% in well-known taxa such as the Enterobacterales order. The remaining plasmids represent novel PTUs, indicating that a large fraction of plasmid backbones is still uncharacterized.,COPLA is a bioinformatic tool for universal, species-independent, plasmid classification. Offered both as an automatable pipeline and an open web service, COPLA will help bacterial geneticists and clinical microbiologists to quickly classify plasmids.',\n",

A sample of 3,618 participants aged 60 to 95 years and without CVD at baseline were followed for four years. FRS was calculated at baseline. Frailty status was defined as not-frail (0-2 criteria) or frail (3-5 criteria) based on the physical frailty phenotype consisting of five binary criteria (weakness, slowness, exhaustion, low activity level, and weight loss). After excluding subjects who were frail (n = 248) at baseline, discrete-time Cox regression was used to evaluate the relationship between FRS and incident frailty.,During a median follow-up of 4.0 years, 323 (8 %) participants developed CVD and 318 (11 %) subjects had frailty onset. Higher FRS was associated with greater risk of incident frailty (HR: 1.03, 95 % CI: 1.00 to 1.06) after adjusting for education, marital status, obesity, comorbidity burden, and cognitive function. This association however was no longer significant (HR: 1.00, 95 % CI: 0.97 to 1.03) after additionally adjusting for age. These findings remained essentially unchanged after excluding subjects with depression (n = 590) at baseline or incident CVD (n = 323) during the 4-year follow-up.,The FRS was not independently associated with incident frailty after adjusting for chronological age.

We validated InvertypeR by re-genotyping inversions reported for three trios by the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium. Although 6.3% of the family inversion genotypes in the original study showed Mendelian discordance, this was reduced to 0.5% using InvertypeR.

              " 'Since the novel coronavirus disease outbreak, over 179.7 million people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, including the population living in dengue-endemic regions, particularly Latin America and Southeast Asia, raising concern about the impact of possible co-infections.,Thirteen SARS-CoV-2/DENV co-infection cases reported in Midwestern Brazil between April and September of 2020 are described. Information was gathered from hospital medical records regarding the most relevant clinical and laboratory findings, diagnostic process, therapeutic interventions, together with clinician-assessed outcomes and follow-up.,Of the 13 cases, seven patients presented Acute Undifferentiated Febrile Syndrome and six had pre-existing co-morbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension and hypopituitarism. Two patients were pregnant. The most common symptoms and clinical signs reported at first evaluation were myalgia, fever and dyspnea. In six cases, the initial diagnosis was dengue fever, which delayed the diagnosis of concomitant infections. The most frequently applied therapeutic interventions were antibiotics and analgesics. In total, four patients were hospitalized. None of them were transferred to the intensive care unit or died. Clinical improvement was verified in all patients after a maximum of 21 days.,The cases reported here highlight the challenges in differential diagnosis and the importance of considering concomitant infections, especially to improve clinical management and possible prevention measures. Failure to consider a SARS-CoV-2/DENV co-infection may impact both individual and community levels, especially in endemic areas.',\n",

Brain MRI revealed a multicystic lesion in the left temporal lobe. Anti-fungal treatment was escalated for a suspected cryptococcoma, but post-mortem CSF serological test confirmed racemose neurocysticercosis.,Patients with HIV-associated CM are highly immunocompromised and may have multiple pathologies simultaneously. In endemic countries, neurocysticercosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis where there is central nervous system deterioration despite effective therapy for CM.',\n",
              " 'The aim of the present study was to develop a clinical scoring system for the diagnosis of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) with improved accuracy.,A retrospective analysis was performed on standardized patient history and clinical examination data obtained from 1435 pediatric patients under the age of three years who presented with acute rash illness and underwent enterovirus nucleic acid detection. Patients were then divided into the HFMD (1094 patients) group or non-HFMD (341 patients) group based on a positive or a negative result from the assay, respectively. We then divided the data into a training set (1004 cases, 70%) and a test set (431 cases, 30%) using a random number method. Multivariate logistic regression was performed on 15 clinical variables (e.g. age, exposure history, number of rash spots in a single body region) to identify variables highly predictive of a positive diagnosis in the training set. Using the variables with high impact on the diagnostic accuracy, we generated a scoring system for predicting HFMD and subsequently evaluated this system in the test set by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve).,Using the logistic model, we identified seven clinical variables (age, exposure history, and rash density at specific regions of the body) to be included into the scoring system. The final scores ranged from - 5 to 24 (higher scores positively predicted HFMD diagnosis). Through our training set, a cutoff score of 7 resulted in a sensitivity of 0.76 and specificity of 0.68. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.804 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.773-0.835) (P < 0.001). Using the test set, we obtained an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.710-0.810) with a sensitivity of 0.76 and a specificity of 0.62. These results from the test set were consistent with those from the training set.,This study establishes an objective scoring system for the diagnosis of typical and atypical HFMD using measures accessible through routine clinical encounters. Due to the accuracy and sensitivity achieved by this scoring system, it can be employed as a rapid, low-cost method for establishing diagnoses in children with acute rash illness.',\n",

The host reaction to HIS remains unclear, and we examined HIS-related mucosal inflammatory features histologically.,From the archival HIS cases in a single medical center, 24 endoscopically taken specimens from 14 HIS cases (male:female = 10:4; 28-73 yrs) were selected as not containing polypoid or neoplastic lesions. Stromal neutrophils, eosinophils, and mast cells, and intraepithelial neutrophils and eosinophils, (sNeu, sEo, sMast, iNeu, and iEo, respectively) were counted, and the presence or absence of lymphoid follicles/aggregates (LFs) was also examined. Association of the above inflammation parameters and spirochetal infection parameters (such as degrees of characteristic fringe distribution, of spirochetal cryptal invasion, and of spirochetal intraepithelial invasion) were also analysed.,iNeu was observed in 29.2%, iEo in 58.3%, and LFs in 50.0% of the specimens. Maximal counts of sNeu, sEo, sMast, iNeu, and iEo averaged 8.4, 21.5, 6.0, 0.5 and 1.5, respectively. Strong correlation between the maximum counts of iNeu and iEo (p < 0.001, r = 0.81), and correlations between those of iEo and sNeu (p = 0.0012, r = 0.62) and between those of iEo and sEo (p = 0.026, r = 0.45) were observed. iNeu was influenced by fringe formation (p < 0.05) and spirochetal crypt involvement (p < 0.05).,HIS was accompanied by inflammatory reactions, and among these, mucosal eosinophilic infiltration may be a central indicator and host reaction of HIS.',\n",
              " \"Data monitoring of clinical trials is a tool aimed at reducing the risks of random errors (e.g. clerical errors) and systematic errors, which include misinterpretation, misunderstandings, and fabrication. Traditional 'good clinical practice data monitoring' with on-site monitors increases trial costs and is time consuming for the local investigators. This paper aims to outline our approach of time-effective central data monitoring for the SafeBoosC-III multicentre randomised clinical trial and present the results from the first three central data monitoring meetings.,The present approach to central data monitoring was implemented for the SafeBoosC-III trial, a large, pragmatic, multicentre, randomised clinical trial evaluating the benefits and harms of treatment based on cerebral oxygenation monitoring in preterm infants during the first days of life versus monitoring and treatment as usual. We aimed to optimise completeness and quality and to minimise deviations, thereby limiting random and systematic errors. We designed an automated report which was blinded to group allocation, to ease the work of data monitoring. The central data monitoring group first reviewed the data using summary plots only, and thereafter included the results of the multivariate Mahalanobis distance of each centre from the common mean. The decisions of the group were manually added to the reports for dissemination, information, correcting errors, preventing furture errors and documentation.,The first three central monitoring meetings identified 156 entries of interest, decided upon contacting the local investigators for 146 of these, which resulted in correction of 53 entries. Multiple systematic errors and protocol violations were identified, one of these included 103/818 randomised participants. Accordingly, the electronic participant record form (ePRF) was improved to reduce ambiguity.,We present a methodology for central data monitoring to optimise quality control and quality development. The initial results included identification of random errors in data entries leading to correction of the ePRF, systematic protocol violations, and potential protocol adherence issues. Central data monitoring may optimise concurrent data completeness and may help timely detection of data deviations due to misunderstandings or fabricated data.\",\n",

As a consequence, an increasing number of computational techniques are developed to facilitate data analysis. There is also a need for versatile user friendly tools that can be used for a de novo exploration of datasets.,Here we present MATLAB-based Analysis toolbox for in situ sequencing (ISS) expression maps (Matisse). We demonstrate Matisse by characterizing the 2-dimensional spatial expression of 119 genes profiled in a mouse coronal section, exploring different levels of complexity. Additionally, in a comprehensive analysis, we further analyzed expression maps from a second technology, osmFISH, targeting a similar mouse brain region.,Matisse proves to be a valuable tool for initial exploration of in situ sequencing datasets. The wide set of tools integrated allows for simple analysis, using the position of individual reads, up to more complex clustering and dimensional reduction approaches, taking cellular content into account. The toolbox can be used to analyze one or several samples at a time, even from different spatial technologies, and it includes different segmentation approaches that can be useful in the analysis of spatially resolved transcriptomic datasets.',\n",
              " \"Patients' failure to adhere to TB treatment was a major challenge that leads to poor treatment outcomes. In Ethiopia, TB treatment success was low as compared with the global threshold. Despite various studies done in TB treatment adherence, little was known specifically in continuation phase where TB treatment is mainly patient-centered. This study aimed to determine adherence to TB treatment and its determinants among adult patients during continuation phase.,We deployed a facility-based cross-sectional study design supplemented with qualitative data to explore perspectives of focal healthcare providers. The study population was all adult (=18 years) TB patients enrolled in the continuation phase and focal healthcare workers in TB clinics. The study included 307 TB patients from 22 health facilities and nine TB focal healthcare providers purposively selected as key-informant. A short (11 questions) version Adherence to Refill and Medication Scale (ARMS) was used for measuring adherence. Data was collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and in-depth interview for qualitative data. Binary logistic regression was applied to identify factors associated with patient adherence. We followed a thematic analysis for the qualitative data. The audio data was transcribed, coded and categorized into themes using OpenCode software.,Among 307 participants, 64.2% (95% CI (58.6-69.4%) were adherent to TB treatment during continuation phase. A multi-variable analysis shown that secondary education (AOR = 4.138, 95% CI; 1.594-10.74); good provider-patient relationship (AOR = 1.863, 95% CI; 1.014-3.423); good knowledge on TB treatment (AOR = 1.845, 95% CI; 1.012-3.362) and middle family wealth (AOR = 2.646, 95% CI; 1.360-5.148) were significantly associated with adherence to TB treatment. The majority (58%) of patients mentioned forgetfulness, and followed by 17.3% of them traveling away from home without pills as major reasons for non-adherence to TB treatment.,The study indicated that patients' adherence to TB treatment remains low during continuation phase. The patient's education level, knowledge, family wealth, and provider-patient relationship were found positively associated with patient adherence. Forgetfulness, traveling away, and feeling sick were major reasons for non-adherence to TB treatment. Interventional studies are needed on those factors to improve patient adherence to TB treatment during continuation phase.\",\n",

People from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) often face interaction between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease. Role of HIV infection and anti-retroviral treatment (ART) in altered cardiovascular risk is questionable and there is still need to further carry out research in this field. However, thus far it is unclear, what impact the COVID-19 co-infection in people living with HIV (PLHIV), with or without therapy will have. The ENDOCOVID project aims to investigate whether and how HIV-infection in COVID-19 patients modulates the time course of the disease, alters cardiovascular risk, and changes vascular endothelial function and coagulation parameters/ thrombosis risk.,A total of 1026 patients will be included into this study. Cardiovascular research PLHIV with (n = 114 in each of the three recruiting centers) - or without - ART (n = 114 in each of the three recruiting centers) with COVID-19 and HIV-negative with COVID-19 (n = 114 in each of the three recruiting centers) will be carried out via clinical and biochemical measurements for cardiovascular risk factors and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Vascular and endothelial function will be measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) assessments, and retinal blood vessel analyses, along with vascular endothelial biomarkers and cogualation markers. The correlation between HIV-infection in COVID-19 PLHIV with or without ART and its role in enhancement of cardiovascular risk and endothelial dysfunction will be assessed at admission, weekly, at discharge and, 4 weeks post-discharge (if possible).,The ENDOCOVID project aims to evaluate in the long-term the cardiovascular risk and vascular endothelial function in PLHIV thus revealing an important transitional cardiovascular phenotype in COVID-19.

This study aims to assess if sociodemographic characteristics are associated with self-reported HIV positive status among YMSM from three Latin American countries.,Cross-sectional web-based survey advertised on dating apps (Grindr and Hornet) and Facebook in Brazil, Mexico and Peru. For this analysis, we included YMSM aged 18-24 years who self-reported their HIV status. We used multivariable logistic regression models for each country separately to verify if sociodemographic characteristics (race, education and income) were\\xa0associated with HIV self-reported status after adjusting for behavior characteristics (sexual attraction and steady partner).,Among 43,687 MSM who initiated the questionnaire, 27,318 (62.5%) reported their HIV status; 7001 (25.6%) of whom were YMSM. Most YMSM (83.4%) reported an HIV test in the past year, and 15.7% reported an HIV positive status in Peru, 8.4% in Mexico and 7.7% in Brazil. In adjusted models, low-income was associated with higher odds of self-reported HIV positive status in Brazil (aOR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.01-1.75) and Peru (aOR = 1.56, 95%CI: 1.02-2.40), but not in Mexico. Lower education was associated with higher odds of self-reported HIV positive status only in Brazil (aOR = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.05-1.75).,In this large, cross-country study, self-reported HIV positive status among YMSM was high. Lower socioeconomic status was associated with higher odds of self-reported HIV positive status in Brazil and Peru. There is an urgent need for HIV prevention interventions targeting YMSM, and\\xa0efforts to address low-income YMSM are especially needed in Peru and Brazil.',\n",
              " 'Diversity among phenology-related genes is predicted to be a contributing factor in local adaptations seen in widely distributed plant species that grow in climatically variable geographic areas, such as forest trees. European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is widespread, and is one of the most important broadleaved tree species in Europe; however, its potential for adaptation to climate change is a matter of uncertainty, and little is known about the molecular basis of climate change-relevant traits like bud burst.,We explored single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at candidate genes related to bud burst in beech individuals sampled across 47 populations from Europe. SNP diversity was monitored for 380 candidate genes using a sequence capture approach, providing 2909 unlinked SNP loci. We used two complementary analytical methods to find loci significantly associated with geographic variables, climatic variables (expressed as principal components), or phenotypic variables (spring and autumn phenology, height, survival). Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to detect candidate markers across two spatial scales (entire study area and within subregions). We revealed 201 candidate SNPs at the broadest scale, 53.2% of which were associated with phenotypic variables. Additive polygenic scores, which provide a measure of the cumulative signal across significant candidate SNPs, were correlated with a climate variable (first principal component, PC1) related to temperature and precipitation availability, and spring phenology. However, different genotype-environment associations were identified within Southeastern Europe as compared to the entire geographic range of European beech.,Environmental conditions play important roles as drivers of genetic diversity of phenology-related genes that could influence local adaptation in European beech. Selection in beech favors genotypes with earlier bud burst under warmer and wetter habitats within its range; however, selection pressures may differ across spatial scales.',\n",
              " 'Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection can cause severe reproductive failure in sows and respiratory distress in pigs of all ages, leading to major economic losses. To date, there are still no effective strategies to prevent and control PRRSV. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a phenomenon in which preexisting non-neutralizing antibodies or sub-neutralizing antibodies facilitate virus entry and replication, may be a significant obstacle in the development of effective vaccines for many viruses, including PRRSV. However, the contribution of ADE to PRRSV infection remains controversial, especially in vivo. Whether attenuated PRRSV vaccines prevent or worsen subsequent disease in pigs infected by novel PRRSV strains requires more research. In the present study, in vivo experiments were conducted to evaluate ADE under different immune statuses, which were produced by waiting different lengths of time after vaccination with a commercially available attenuated highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) vaccine (JXA1-R) before challenging the pigs with a novel heterologous NADC30-like strain.,Piglets that were vaccinated before being challenged with PRRSV exhibited lower mortality rates, lower body temperatures, higher bodyweight gain, and lower viremia. These results demonstrate that vaccination with JXA1-R alleviated the clinical signs of PRRSV infection in all vaccinated groups.,The obtained data indicate that the attenuated vaccine test here provided partial protection against the NADC30-like strain HNhx. No signs of enhanced PRRSV infection were observed under the applied experimental conditions. Our results provide some insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying vaccine-induced protection or enhancement in PRRSV.',\n",

However, HIV treatment among the youths is characterized by loss to follow up, poor adherence to ART, risk of treatment failure and high mortality rates compared to young children and adults. There is limited information about factors associated with retention of youths in HIV care in rural settings in Uganda. We aimed to determine retention in HIV care and associated factors among youths aged 15-24 years in rural southwestern Uganda.,A cross-sectional study was conducted among youths aged 15-24 years who were receiving care at the HIV clinic at Kabuyanda HC IV who had been in care for at least 1 year before the study. We used an interviewer-administered questionnaire to collect socio-demographic information. Participant chart abstraction was used to collect information on HIV clinic attendance. We collected information on HIV related stigma using the 40-item Berger Stigma Scale. Chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to determine the factors associated with retention in HIV care with a significance level of < 0.05. Retention in HIV care was, defined as having sought care at least once per quarter in the 12 months prior to the study.,We enrolled 102 participants with a mean age of 20.95 (SD ± 3.07) years. Two thirds (65.7%) of the youths had been retained in HIV care in the previous 12 months. In adjusted analyses, being male, married and had perinatally acquired HIV were independently associated with retention in HIV care. The association between HIV related stigma and retention in HIV care was not statistically significant.,Retaining adolescents and young adults in HIV care in rural southwestern Uganda is still much lower than the WHO target of 90%. Being male, having perinatally acquired HIV and married or in a relationship are associated with retention in HIV care. Interventions targeting adolescents and young adults living with HIV are necessary to improve retention in HIV care to the WHO target of 90%.',\n",

Thus, new TKI-based combination therapies should be urgently explored to extend the overall survival time of these patients. CD8 + CD56+ natural killer T (NKT) cells are a natural and unique subset of lymphocytes in humans that present characteristics of T and NK cells and exert cytotoxicity on tumour cells in a granzyme B-dependent manner. The aim of this trial was to explore the efficacy and safety of CD8 + CD56+ NKT cell immunotherapy combined with gefitinib in patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC.,The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, phase I/II trial that includes 30 patients with EGFR mutation-positive stage III/IV NSCLC. All patients will be randomized in blocks at a 1:1 ratio and treated with gefitinib 250 mg/day monotherapy or combination therapy with allogeneic CD8 + CD56+ NKT cell infusions twice per month for 12 cycles or until disease progression occurs. The effectiveness of this treatment will be evaluated based on by progression-free survival (PFS), the time to progression (TTP), overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and overall survival (OS). The safety of the trail is being assessed based on adverse events (AEs). Recruitment and data collection, which started in December 2017, are ongoing.,Although immunotherapy, including programmed death-1/programmed death-1 ligand\\xa0(PD-1/PD-L1) immunotherapy, has been used for NSCLC treatment with or without EGFR-TKIs, its clear efficacy still has not been shown.

Inpatient cost data were obtained from the hospital patient records. Using a questionnaire, the data regarding outpatient costs were collected through a phone interview with patients at least six months after the fracture incidence. Direct medical and non-medical costs were estimated from a societal perspective. All costs were converted to the US dollar using the average exchange rate in 2017 (1USD = IRR 34,214) RESULTS: The mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of the patient was 69.83 ± 11.25\\xa0years, and 68% were female. One hundred and seventeen (39%) patients had hip fractures, 56 (18.67%) patients had vertebral fractures, and 127 (42.33%) ones had forearm fractures.

We also assessed the associated factors with TEC in the patients with intermittent exotropia (IXT).,In this retrospective study, IXT patients were exposed to different brightness: darkness, low-intensity white light, and high-intensity white light using a near-infrared camera vision monitor system (Mon CV3, Metrovision, France). TEC was considered to be present if the subject closed his or her eyes immediately, and for more than half of the scotopic lid fissure distance in response to the high-intensity or low-intensity photopic stimulus of light, compared with lid fissure distance in the scotopic phase. We assessed the presence of photosensitivity using a questionnaire and evaluated the agreement between TEC and photosensitivity. We also investigated the sensory fusion, motor fusion, and pupil dynamic components for the existence of TEC in IXT patients.,Sixty-one patients with IXT were included. With the new method to evaluate TEC under different light intensities, 27 (44.3%) of the 61 IXT patients showed TEC, and 34 (55.7%) did not demonstrate TEC. TEC under high-intensity white light had a strong correlation with self-reporting photosensitivity (r = 0.77). The smaller angle of deviation at near was associated with the presence of TEC, with statistical significance (p = 0.04). Normal sensory status at a distance was significantly associated with TEC (p < \\xa00.01). Multivariate analysis using multiple logistic regression analysis showed that normal sensory status was significantly associated with TEC (p = 0.02).,The test using a near-infrared camera vision monitor system was a simple and objective tool in identifying TEC evoked by bright light. The presence of TEC strongly correlated with self-reporting photosensitivity in patients with IXT. However, TEC may be an independent phenomenon with motor alignment, stereopsis, and pupil reflex pathway in patients with IXT.',\n",

Vital statistics registration systems are often the preferred source of information about cause-specific mortality because they capture verified information about the deceased, but they may not always be accessible for linkage with other sources of population-based data. We assessed the validity of an algorithm applied to administrative health records for identifying cardiovascular deaths in population-based data.,Administrative health records were from an existing multi-database cohort study about sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a new class of antidiabetic medications. Data were from 2013 to 2018 for five Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec) and the United Kingdom (UK) Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The cardiovascular mortality algorithm was based on in-hospital cardiovascular deaths identified from diagnosis codes and select out-of-hospital deaths. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were calculated for the cardiovascular mortality algorithm using vital statistics registrations as the reference standard. Overall and stratified estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed; the latter were produced by site, location of death, sex, and age.,The cohort included 20,607 individuals (58.3% male; 77.2% =70 years). When compared to vital statistics registrations, the cardiovascular mortality algorithm had overall sensitivity of 64.8% (95% CI 63.6, 66.0); site-specific estimates ranged from 54.8 to 87.3%. Overall specificity was 74.9% (95% CI 74.1, 75.6) and overall PPV was 54.5% (95% CI 53.7, 55.3), while site-specific PPV ranged from 33.9 to 72.8%. The cardiovascular mortality algorithm had sensitivity of 57.1% (95% CI 55.4, 58.8) for in-hospital deaths and 72.3% (95% CI 70.8, 73.9) for out-of-hospital deaths; specificity was 88.8% (95% CI 88.1, 89.5) for in-hospital deaths and 58.5% (95% CI 57.3, 59.7) for out-of-hospital deaths.,A cardiovascular mortality algorithm applied to administrative health records had moderate validity when compared to vital statistics data.

              " 'Patterns of failure after treatment of oral and squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) are diversified, with recurrences being one of the common causes. A special group of patients are sometimes encountered in the outpatient clinic for improper or insufficient initial treatment with reports of positive margins, implying residual/persistent diseases. The question of whether these patients can be surgically salvaged remain unanswered.,A retrospective study was performed between January 2013 and December 2017 for patients with residual or rapid recurrent (within 3 months) OSCCs, who received salvage surgeries in our institution. The patients with residual/persistent OSCCs were those with microscopic or macroscopic positive surgical margins, while those with rapid recurrent OSCCs were those with close or negative margins, but unabated painful symptoms right after treatment. Both clinicopathological and prognostic variables were analyzed. The focus was also directed towards lessons for possible initial mistakes, resulting in these residual/persistent diseases.,Of 103 patients, 68 (66%) were men, with mean age of 56.3 years. The overall survival reached 60.2%. Regarding the primary OSCC status, most of our patients (n = 75, 72.8%) were diagnosed with ycT2-3 stages. Besides, most patients were found with macroscopic residual diseases (52.4%) before our salvage surgery. The sizes of the residual/persistent OSCCs were generally under 4 cm (87.3%) with minimally residual in 21 (20.4%). Among all the variables, primary T stage (p = 0.003), and residual lesion size (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with the prognosis in multivariate analysis. Though the causes for the initial surgical failure were multifactorial, most were stemmed from poor planning and unstandardized execution.,Cases with residual/persistent OSCCs were mostly due to mistakes which could have been avoided under well-round treatment plans and careful surgical practice. Salvage surgery for cases with smaller residual/persistent OSCCs is still feasible with acceptable outcomes.',\n",

Our objective was to determine potential sex differences in self-reported overall health and access to healthcare and whether those differences are influenced by individual social factors in two relatively similar countries.,Two public health surveys from countries with high gender equality (measured by UN GII) and universal healthcare systems, Canada (CCHS2014, n = 57,041) and Austria (AT-HIS2014, n = 15,212), were analysed. Perceived health was assessed on a scale of 1 (very bad) to 4 (very good) and perceived unmet healthcare needs was reported as a dichotomous variable (yes/no). Interactions between sex and social determinants (i.e. employment, education level, immigration and marital status) on outcomes were analysed.,Individuals in both countries reported high perceived health (Scoring > 2, 85.0% in Canada, 79.9% in Austria) and a low percentage reported unmet healthcare needs (4.6% in Canada, 10.7% in Austria). In both countries, sex and several social factors were associated with high perceived health, and a sex-by-marital status interaction was observed, with a greater negative impact of divorce for men. Female sex was positively associated with unmet care needs in both countries, and sex-by-social factors interactions were only detected in Canada.,The intersection of sex and social factors in influencing patient-relevant outcomes varies even among countries with similar healthcare and high gender equality.',\n",
              " 'Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) impact both human and veterinary medicine and pose special public health challenges. The main bacterial vector-borne pathogens (VBPs) of importance in veterinary medicine include Anaplasma spp., Bartonella spp., Ehrlichia spp., and Spotted Fever Group Rickettsia. Taxon-targeted PCR assays are the current gold standard for VBP diagnostics but limitations on the detection of genetically diverse organisms support a novel approach for broader detection of VBPs. We present a methodology for genetic characterization of VBPs using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and computational approaches. A major advantage of NGS is the ability to detect multiple organisms present in the same clinical sample in an unsupervised (i.e. non-targeted) and semi-quantitative way. The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) presented here combines industry-standard microbiome analysis tools with our ad-hoc bioinformatic scripts to form a complete analysis pipeline accessible to veterinary scientists and freely available for download and use at https://github.com/eltonjrv/microbiome.westernu/tree/SOP .,We tested and validated our SOP by mimicking single, double, and triple infections in genomic canine DNA using serial dilutions of plasmids containing the entire 16\\xa0S rRNA gene sequence of (A) phagocytophilum, (B) v. berkhoffii, and E. canis. NGS with broad-range 16\\xa0S rRNA primers followed by our bioinformatics SOP was capable of detecting these pathogens in biological replicates of different dilutions. These results illustrate the ability of NGS to detect and genetically characterize multi-infections with different amounts of pathogens in a single sample.,Bloodborne microbiomics & metagenomics approaches may help expand the molecular diagnostic toolbox in veterinary and human medicine. In this paper, we present both in vitro and in silico detailed protocols that can be combined into a single workflow that may provide a significant improvement in VBP diagnostics and also facilitate future applications of microbiome research in veterinary medicine.',\n",
              " 'The monitoring framework for evaluating health system response to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) include indicators to assess availability of affordable basic technologies and essential medicines to treat them in both public and private primary care facilities. The Government of India launched the National Program for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) in 2010 to strengthen health systems. We assessed availability of trained human resources, essential medicines and technologies for diabetes, cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases as one of the components of the National Noncommunicable Disease Monitoring Survey (NNMS - 2017-18).,NNMS was a cross-sectional survey. Health facility survey component covered three public [Primary health centre (PHC), Community health centre (CHC) and District hospital (DH)] and one private primary in each of the 600 primary sampling units (PSUs) selected by stratified multistage random sampling to be nationally representative. Survey teams interviewed medical officers, laboratory technicians, and pharmacists using an adapted World Health Organization (WHO) - Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) tool on handhelds with Open Data Kit (ODK) technology. List of essential medicines and technology was according to WHO - Package of Essential Medicines and Technologies for NCDs (PEN) and NPCDCS guidelines for primary and secondary facilities, respectively. Availability was defined as reported to be generally available within facility premises.,Total of 537 public and 512 private primary facilities, 386 CHCs and 334 DHs across India were covered. NPCDCS was being implemented in 72.8% of CHCs and 86.8% of DHs. All essential technologies and medicines available to manage three NCDs in primary care varied between 1.1% (95% CI; 0.3-3.3) in rural public to 9.0% (95% CI; 6.2-13.0) in urban private facilities. In NPCDCS implementing districts, 0.4% of CHCs and 14.5% of the DHs were fully equipped. DHs were well staffed, CHCs had deficits in physiotherapist and specialist positions, whereas PHCs reported shortage of nurse-midwives and health assistants. Training under NPCDCS was uniformly poor across all facilities.,Both private and public primary care facilities and public secondary facilities are currently not adequately prepared to comprehensively address the burden of NCDs in India.',\n",
